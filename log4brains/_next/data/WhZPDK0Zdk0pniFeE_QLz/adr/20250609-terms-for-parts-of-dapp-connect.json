It helps if terms are established for these important parts and then used consistently throughout the codebase and the documentation.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Descriptiveness:** Each term need to sufficiently descriptive and succinct\n- **Similarity to other terms:** To prevent confusion, each term should not be too similar to terms that are already used elsewhere\n- **Prior use in project:** It is easier to use the terms that has been used frequently in this project's documentation and code\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to establish terms for the parts of DApp Connect the following way:\n\n- **dApp connect server** - The <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"local server\" /> embedded within the desktop wallet for connecting to dApps. *May be shortened to \"connect server\" or \"server\".*\n- **dApp connect session** - The secure connection established between a dApp and the server. *May be shortened to \"connect session\" or \"session\".*\n- **dApp connect session ID** - The public key that is used to uniquely identify the connect session for the server. *May be shortened to \"connect session ID\" or \"session ID\".*\n- **dApp connect session key** - The unique private key generated by the server for the connect session. *May be shortened to \"connect session key\" or \"session key\".*\n- **dApp connect session key pair** - A pair that consists of the session key and session ID. *May be shortened to \"connect session key pair\" or \"session key pair\".*\n- **dApp ID** - The public key that usually (but not necessarily) uniquely identifies the dApp to the server.\n- **dApp key** - The private key generated by the dApp.\n- **dApp key pair** - A pair that consists of the dApp key and dApp ID.\n- **dApp connect shared key** - The shared secret key derived and established [using ECDH between a dApp and the connect server](20250609-use-ecdh-for-hawk-shared-secret-key.md). *May be shortened to \"connect shared key\" or \"shared key\"*.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- Consistent use of a clear terms improves documentation and code\n- Less work in the long run\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Older documentation and code that used other terms need to be revisited and edited to use newly decided terms\n- More work is necessary immediately\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240821-use-hawk-for-dapp-connection-authentication-and-authorization\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Hawk for DApp Connection Authentication and Authorization\" customLabel=\"Use Hawk for DApp Connection Authentication and Authorization\" />\n- Relates to [Use \\\"DApp\\\" in Prose and \\\"Dapp\\\" in Code](20250608-use-dapp-in-prose-and-dapp-in-code.md)\n- Relates to [Use ECDH for Hawk Shared Secret Key](20250609-use-ecdh-for-hawk-shared-secret-key.md)\n"},"creationDate":"2025-06-09T10:38:52.000Z","lastEditDate":"2025-06-11T20:50:48.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"No-Cash-7970","publicationDate":"2025-06-10T06:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/decisions/20250609-terms-for-parts-of-dapp-connect.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/duckySigner/duckySigner/docs/decisions/20250609-terms-for-parts-of-dapp-connect.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/duckySigner/blob/master/docs/decisions/20250609-terms-for-parts-of-dapp-connect.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.1.0"},"__N_SSG":true}
