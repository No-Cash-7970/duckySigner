The process for designing for security should be effective and transparent.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security:** Should be a process that enables an easy and maintainable way of communicating and mitigating security concerns.\n- **Transparency:** Security concerns should be documented and available to the public, along with how those security concerns are addressed.\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to document the threat model as a Markdown document. This document should be maintained as the system changes and more information is known. Threat modeling should be done regularly, perhaps for every release with a version bump.\n\n**Confidence**: High. Creating and maintaining documentation of the threat model will likely be proven to be essential for this use case (an Algorand desktop wallet).\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- Easier for the other developers, security professionals or end-users to evaluate the security risks of the software and what is being done about those risks.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Requires more time and effort, which is less time and effort for building the software\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20231231-build-algorand-desktop-wallet\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet\" customLabel=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet\" />\n- [Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet - OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [Threat Modeling Process](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process)\n- [Threat Modeling in Practice](https://owasp.org/www-project-developer-guide/draft/design/threat_modeling/practical_threat_modeling/)\n- [Threat modeling using C4 diagrams](https://medium.com/flat-pack-tech/threat-modeling-as-code-f3555f5d9024)\n"},"creationDate":"2024-02-20T05:46:26.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-02-20T05:46:26.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"No-Cash-7970","publicationDate":"2024-02-20T07:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/decisions/20240219-document-threat-model.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/duckySigner/duckySigner/docs/decisions/20240219-document-threat-model.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/duckySigner/blob/master/docs/decisions/20240219-document-threat-model.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
