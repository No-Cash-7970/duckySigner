Much of KMD's code for managing keys should be able to be ported because it is written in Go. Using KMD's code would make it easier to provide a high enough level of security to keep the user's keys safe.\n\n**Confidence**: High. SQLite is a well-established file-based database with a wide range of support.\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20231231-build-algorand-desktop-wallet\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet\" customLabel=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet\" />\n- [KMD code](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/tree/eceed7c0d3df0f412ede27c1aa2b68e0fa21ccab/daemon/kmd)\n- [KMD code for managing keys with SQLite](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/blob/master/daemon/kmd/wallet/driver/sqlite.go)\n- [KMD code for the mechanisms used to encrypt keys](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/blob/master/daemon/kmd/wallet/driver/sqlite_crypto.go)\n"},"creationDate":"2024-01-04T21:20:21.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-02-19T08:29:36.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"No-Cash-7970","publicationDate":"2024-01-05T07:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/decisions/20240103-use-sqlite-database-to-store-keys.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/duckySigner/duckySigner/docs/decisions/20240103-use-sqlite-database-to-store-keys.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/duckySigner/blob/master/docs/decisions/20240103-use-sqlite-database-to-store-keys.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
