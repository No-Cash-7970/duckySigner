It helps if vocabulary terms are established for these important parts and then used consistently throughout the codebase and documentation.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Descriptiveness:** Each term needs to be sufficiently descriptive and succinct\n- **Prior use in project:** It is easier to use the terms that has been used frequently in this project's documentation and code\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to establish the following terms for the parts of DApp Connect:\n\n- **confirmation code** - A string of letters and/or numbers displayed to the user by the dApp to be entered into the wallet during session confirmation\n- **confirmation ID** - An <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" /> public key used to uniquely identify a session confirmation to the server\n- **confirmation key pair** - A pair consisting of a confirmation key and its corresponding confirmation ID\n- **confirmation secret key** - An <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" /> private key generated by the server for session confirmation\n- **confirmation shared secret key** - An <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" /> shared secret key that only the server and a single dApp should have when establishing a session. It is used to confirm an initialized session.\n  - *Aliases: \"confirmation shared key\", \"confirmation shared secret\", \"shared secret key\", \"shared secret\", \"shared key\"*\n- **confirmation token** - A small collection of data that is encrypted by the server and given to the dApp for it to be able to confirm its session\n- **dApp ID** - An <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" /> public key that usually (but not necessarily) uniquely identifies a dApp to the server\n- **dApp key pair** - A pair consisting of a dApp key and its corresponding dApp ID\n- **dApp secret key** - An <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" /> private key generated by a dApp\n  - *Aliases: \"dApp key\", \"secret key\"*\n- **server** - The <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"local server\" /> embedded within the desktop wallet for connecting to dApps\n- **session** - A secure connection established between a dApp and the server\n- **session confirmation** - The process for a dApp to confirm its identity by proving to the server its possession of its dApp key. Confirmation also includes the user confirming their desire to connect a dApp to the wallet by entering a confirmation code into the wallet.\n- **session establishment** - The whole process of creating a new session, which consists of initializing the session and then confirming it\n- **session ID** - An <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" /> public key used to uniquely identify a session to the server\n- **session initialization** - The process of starting a new session, which consists of a dApp presenting its dApp ID to the server\n- **session key pair** - A pair consisting of a session key and its corresponding session ID\n- **session secret key** - An <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" /> private key generated by the server for a session\n  - *Aliases: \"session key\", \"secret key\"\n- **session shared secret key** - An <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" /> shared secret key that only the server and a single dApp should have during a session\n  - *Aliases: \"session shared key\", \"session shared secret\", \"shared secret key\", \"shared secret\", \"shared key\"*\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- Consistent use of a clear terms improves documentation and code\n- Less work in the long run\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Older documentation and code that used other vocabulary terms need to be revisited and edited to use the newly decided terms\n- More work is necessary in the more immediate term\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to [Use \\\"DApp Connect\\\" Term for Wallet-DApp Connection](20250608-use-dapp-connect-term-for-wallet-dapp-connection.md)\n- Relates to [Use \\\"DApp\\\" in Prose and \\\"Dapp\\\" in Code](20250608-use-dapp-in-prose-and-dapp-in-code.md)\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250619-dapp-connect-protocol\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"DApp Connect Protocol\" customLabel=\"DApp Connect Protocol\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240821-use-hawk-for-dapp-connect-authentication-and-authorization\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Hawk for DApp Connect Authentication and Authorization\" customLabel=\"Use Hawk for DApp Connect Authentication and Authorization\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" />\n"},"creationDate":"2025-06-21T11:24:10.000Z","lastEditDate":"2025-07-04T04:19:15.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"No-Cash-7970","publicationDate":"2025-06-22T06:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/decisions/20250621-vocab-for-dapp-connect.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/duckySigner/duckySigner/docs/decisions/20250621-vocab-for-dapp-connect.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/duckySigner/blob/master/docs/decisions/20250621-vocab-for-dapp-connect.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.1.0"},"__N_SSG":true}
