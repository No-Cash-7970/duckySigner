The server should not get a large number of requests and would need to be able to handle a connection that lasts for several minutes (while waiting for user to respond).\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Ease of use:** Prefer a framework that has a short learning curve and is flexible enough to accommodate fluctuating requirements\n- **Feature set:** Prefer a framework with a wide array features, but looking for features pertaining to persistent connections and security\n- **Documentation and help:** Prefer a framework with clear documentation and an active community that can help with questions\n- **Free and open source:** Must be a framework where the code can be examined and the license allows for commercial use\n- **Lightweight:** Prefer a framework that is lightweight so it consumes a little of the user's computer resources as possible\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Echo\n- Fiber\n- Chi\n- None (Only using Go's `net/http`)\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose Echo because of its included HTTP/2 and web sockets support with a large number of useful examples in the documentation.\n\n**Confidence**: Low. Because what is needed to create the local server for the wallet app is uncertain, it is unclear if Echo is the best option.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Echo\n\nEcho is a \"high performance, extensible, minimalist\" web framework that is one of the most popular options in Go.\n\nWebsite: <https://echo.labstack.com/>\n\n- Pro: Flexible\n- Pro: Well-written documentation with plenty of examples\n- Pro: HTTP/2 support\n- Pro: Easy to get started\n- Pro: WebSocket support\n\n### Fiber\n\nFiber is one of the fastest web frameworks for Go because it is built on top of Fasthttp. The syntax for defining routes is like Express.js.\n\nWebsite: <https://gofiber.io/>\n\n- Pro: Fast\n- Pro: Well-written documentation with plenty of examples\n- Pro: The Express-style syntax is more familiar to the developer (No-Cash-7970)\n- Con: No included HTTP/2 support\n\n### Chi\n\nChi is one of the older web frameworks for Go. It has many features for supporting a small and large systems.\n\nWebsite: <https://go-chi.io/>\n\n- Pro: Flexible\n- Pro: Well-written documentation with plenty of examples\n- Pro: HTTP/2 support\n- Pro: Easy to get started\n\n### None (Only Using Go's `net/http`)\n\nGo's built-in `net/http` package is capable of a lot and serves as the foundation of most Go web frameworks.\n\nWebsite: <https://pkg.go.dev/net/http>\n\n- Pro: Very flexible\n- Pro: HTTP/2 support\n- Pro: Large amount of documentation\n- Pro: Nothing extra to import\n- Con: Requires more time and effort to use because various features would have to be built by hand\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20231231-build-algorand-desktop-wallet-from-scratch\" status=\"superseded\" title=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet From Scratch\" customLabel=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet From Scratch\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240101-build-using-go-and-typescript\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Build Using Go and TypeScript\" customLabel=\"Build Using Go and TypeScript\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-echo-web-framework\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Echo Web Framework\" customLabel=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" />\n"},"creationDate":"2024-01-03T11:18:53.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-07-18T23:37:11.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"No-Cash-7970","publicationDate":"2024-01-04T07:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/decisions/20240102-use-echo-web-framework.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/duckySigner/duckySigner/docs/decisions/20240102-use-echo-web-framework.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/duckySigner/blob/master/docs/decisions/20240102-use-echo-web-framework.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
