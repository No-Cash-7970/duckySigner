How and why to fake it](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940).\n- The MADR format is lean and fits our development style.\n- The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance.\n- The MADR project is vivid.\n- Version 2.1.2 is the latest one available when starting to document ADRs.\n- The Log4brains patch adds more features, like tags.\n\nThe \"Log4brains patch\" performs the following modifications to the original template:\n\n- Change the ADR filenames format (`NNN-adr-name` becomes `YYYYMMDD-adr-name`), to avoid conflicts during Git merges.\n- Add a `draft` status, to enable collaborative writing.\n- Add a `Tags` field.\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20231231-use-log4brains-to-manage-the-adrs\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use

(DApps) in Algorand that fully support most of Algorand's features.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security**: Website wallets and browser extension wallets are not the most secure for holding a user's private keys, but they are the only wallet options for desktop that can interact with DApps in Algorand. A browser extension wallet is typically more secure than a website wallet. The MyAlgo (a website wallet) data breach of user private keys proved how insecure website wallets can be and how devastating such a breach can be.\n- **Longevity:** A website wallet can be shut down and be inaccessible to the user. While browser extension wallets typically do not have this same problem, a user could lose the ability to download and and install the extension if the extension is closed source and removed from the marketplace (like the Chrome Store).\n- **Cross-Platform:** A wallet should be able to be used by most desktop users, most of whom are using either Linux, Mac or Windows operating systems.\n- **Developer Ambition:** The developer (No-Cash-7970) has been a full-stack web developer for years and wants to try building something that is not a website.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Build a desktop wallet that is not a website or browser extension from scratch\n2. Create a graphical user interface (GUI) wrapper for Algorand's Key Management Daemon (KMD)\n3. Do nothing\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to build a desktop wallet from scratch, because if built correctly, the desktop wallet from scratch would be the most secure and possibly longest-lasting solution while giving the developer a chance to build something that is not a website. However, some of KMD's designs can be used as a guide for building a desktop wallet from scratch.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. Building a desktop wallet should be feasible with a reasonable amount of time and effort. However, despite there being some architecture design ideas to achieve the goals for the desktop app, it is unclear if those design ideas will pan out.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Build Desktop Wallet from Scratch\n\nBuild a wallet for desktop that is not a website or a browser extension. The user would download and install the desktop wallet app. The user's keys would stored only on their computer.\n\n- Pro: If built correctly, a desktop wallet that does not depend on the user's browser would be the most secure wallet option for desktop.\n- Pro: Desktop wallet app that is downloaded and installed allows the user more control over the wallet app and more privacy.\n- Pro: This would be a challenge that provides the developer an opportunity to build something potentially useful that is not a website or trivial tutorial.\n- Con: Risky. If the wallet is built insecurely, there could be a massive mess like the MyAlgo breach.\n- Con: Among the options, this requires the most time, effort and research to do well. The ways for users to utilize Algorand's more esoteric and advanced features would have to built from scratch using an Algorand SDK.\n\n### Create a GUI wrapper for KMD\n\nCreate a GUI that gets input from the user and calls KMD using that input. The GUI would merely serve as a more friendly interface for KMD.\n\n- Pro: Would be able to take advantage of KMD's security that was developed by the Algorand team with less effort.\n- Pro: Utilizing KMD would make it easier to support almost all of Algorand's features.\n- Pro: It is a challenge that provides the developer an opportunity to build something potentially useful that is not a website or trivial tutorial.\n- Con: KMD does not work very well with Windows without using Docker and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) because the Algorand node software was built for and tested on \\*nix operating systems (Mac and Linux). It may not be possible to get a working solution for Windows that does not require the user to download and set up Docker and WSL using this option.\n- Con: It is difficult to separate the `kmd` daemon from the [go-algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand) code base into a standalone tool that does not include unnecessary components such as `algod` and `goal`.\n\n### Do Nothing\n\nDo nothing and let the problem remain as it is. Some might say this is the smartest option.\n\n- Pro: The safest, easiest and most comfortable option. Maybe someone else more capable would develop a solution (and a possibly a better one) to the problem.\n- Con: Does not solve the problem. For some reason, no one seems to have taken up solving the problem yet despite there being a demand for a solution. It is possible that no one will ever try to solve this problem because it is deemed too difficult, risky and unprofitable.\n- Con: No challenge for the developer to use as an opportunity.\n\n## Links\n\n- Superseded by <AdrLink slug=\"20240217-integrate-kmd-wallet-management-code\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Integrate KMD Wallet Management Code\" customLabel=\"Integrate KMD Wallet Management Code\" />\n- [List of Algorand tools and infrastructure, which includes wallets](https://algorand.co/ecosystem/infrastructure-tools)\n- [Incident Report about the 2023 MyAlgo data breach](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Incident%20Reports/RandLabs_MyAlgo_Wallet_Executive_Summary_Halborn%20.pdf)\n- [List of Algorand wallets (outdated)](https://developer.algorand.org/ecosystem-projects/?tags=wallets)\n"}],["20240101-build-using-go-and-typescript",{"title":"Build Using Go and TypeScript","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWhich programming language(s) should be used to implement the Algorand wallet for desktop?

Despite the less-than-stellar documentation, the community in the Wails Discord server should be able to assist with issues that may arise. In addition to Wails, Next.js will be used as the TypeScript/JavaScript because the developer is familiar with the framework.\n\n**Confidence**: Medium. It is not clear if using Wails will help produce the desired results within a reasonable amount of time.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Wails\n\nWails is a desktop app framework for building with Go and web technologies (HTML, TypeScript/Javascript, CSS). According to its documentation it is a \"lightweight and fast Electron alternative for Go.\"\n\nWebsite: <https://wails.io/>\n\n- Pro: The developer can utilize her knowledge in frontend web development to build a good-looking modern UI\n- Pro: Utilizes Go, which a language with a lower learning curve that offers great cross-platform support\n- Pro: There is an active Discord server with helpful people who can answer questions\n- Pro: Free and open source under MIT license\n- Con: The documentation is messy and many things are not explained clearly.\n- Con: Many of the tutorials available are outdated and not very useful\n- Con: Some useful features, such as notifications, are not yet supported.\n\n### Gio UI\n\nGio is a cross-platform UI library for Go. It is the most popular option for desktop apps written in Go.\n\nWebsite: <https://gioui.org/>\n\n- Pro: Supports a large number of platforms, including WebAssembly\n- Pro: Free and open source under MIT and Unlicense licenses\n- Pro: Well documented with plenty of tutorials\n- Pro: UI elements are good-looking and modern\n- Con: Has a larger learning curve because of its architecture (e.g. \"immediate mode\", “retained mode”)\n- Con: Seems somewhat inflexible\n\n### Fyne\n\nFyne is a toolkit for developing native desktop apps in Go. It is one of the more popular options for developing desktop apps in Go.\n\nWebsite: <https://fyne.io/>\n\n- Pro: The learning curve is moderate\n- Pro: UI elements are good-looking and modern\n- Pro: Well documented\n- Pro: Free and open source under BSD 3-Clause License\n- Pro: Cross-platform, including support for mobile\n- Con: The appearance of the UI elements seems to be inflexible, which results in most of the apps using Fyne looking similar\n\n### Electron\n\nElectron is a massively popular framework for building desktop apps using web technologies.\n\nWebsite: <https://www.electronjs.org/>\n\n- Pro: The developer can utilize her knowledge in frontend web development to build a good-looking modern UI\n- Pro: Plenty of documentation that is clear and well-organized, as well as plenty of tutorials\n- Pro: Designed to be cross-platform\n- Pro: Free and open source under MIT license\n- Con: Many complaints about apps built with Electron consuming a lot of computing resources.\n\n### Tauri\n\nTauri is a framework for building performant and secure desktop apps with Rust and web technologies\n\nWebsite: <https://tauri.app/>\n\n- Pro: The developer can utilize her knowledge in frontend web development to build a good-looking modern UI\n- Pro: Has great cross-platform support\n- Pro: Many features and UI elements\n- Pro: Free and open source under MIT license\n- Pro: Emphasizes security, which is important for a desktop wallet\n- Pro: Plenty of documentation that is clear and well-organized\n- Con: Uses Rust as the backend.

In Algorand, the one of the main reasons for using wallet software is to connect to DApps.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Protection of user keys:** Connected DApps must not be able to access the user's wallet keys. An unauthorized third-party must not be able to access the user's keys.\n- **Spoofing and fraud prevention:** An unauthorized third-party should not be able to intercept communications and present themselves as something or someone they are not\n- **Stability of connection between DApp and wallet app:** The connection should be reliable for the DApp and the wallet app to communicate\n- **Difficulty for DApps to integrate:** Prefer a method that makes it easy for DApps to connect to the wallet app\n- **User privacy:** User's information should not be sent to the DApp or some third-party. All communications should be contained within the user's machine.\n- **Reasonable usage of computer resources:** Must not consume an \"unreasonable\" amount of the user's computing resources (RAM, storage space, CPU, etc.). The exact definition of \"unreasonable\" has yet to be determined.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Local server REST API\n- WalletConnect\n- A \"DApp store\"\n- Just don't try\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to use a local server REST API because it should not consume much of the user's computing resources while providing a stable and private connection to DApps. Additional well-known protection and security measures, such as SSL/TLS, _may_ be used.\n\n**Confidence**: Low. A local server may not be able to be secure enough. May also be an issue for users with machines that have a strict firewall.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Local Server REST API\n\nAn HTTP(S) server integrated into the wallet app that serves only on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, which should not be exposed to anywhere outside the user's machine. DApps in the browser or installed on the user's machine can connect and interact with this local server through REST API requests. This is a method that Algorand's Key Management Daemon (KMD) uses to securely connect and interact with other services (which may be DApps).\n\n- Pro: Entirely on the user's machine\n- Pro: Almost every kind of software that can connect to the internet is capable of doing REST API calls\n- Pro: HTTP(S) server connections tend to be reliable and widely supported\n- Con: Firewall on user's machine may cause problems\n- Con: May not be secure enough, especially in the scenario where malicious software is installed on the user's machine\n- Con: Requires the development and maintenance of a library for DApps to easily connect and interact with the local server.\n\n### WalletConnect\n\nWalletConnect is the most widespread method for wallets to connect to DApps.\n\n- Pro: The most well-established method for connecting to wallets\n- Pro: If there is a way to integrate into a desktop app, it should require only a little time and effort to get working\n- Con: There seems to be no support for connecting to a wallet that is not a mobile wallet\n- Con: Connection is managed a third-party closed-source system\n- Con: There have been complaints about WalletConnect connections not being reliable\n\n### DApp store\n\nA type of \"app store\" for DApps, which would be integrated into the desktop wallet app. This would be like MyEtherWallet's \"DApps Center\" where MyEtherWallet only interacts with a list of registered DApps.\n\n- Pro: Could provide a nice experience for the user\n- Con: Would take a large amount of time and effort to build and maintain\n- Con: DApp developers would most likely be unwilling spend the time and effort to integrate their DApps into the desktop wallet app\n\n### Just don't try\n\nDo not bother trying to get the desktop wallet to interact with DApps. The desktop wallet would only be for storing keys and looking up the statuses of wallet accounts. Many desktop wallets go with this option.\n\n- Pro: Easiest and most secure option\n- Con: If the wallet app cannot connect to DApps, it is not very useful\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20231231-build-algorand-desktop-wallet-from-scratch\" status=\"superseded\" title=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet From Scratch\" customLabel=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet From Scratch\" />\n- Relates to [Use \\\"DApp\\\" in Prose and \\\"Dapp\\\" in Code](20250608-use-dapp-in-prose-and-dapp-in-code.md)\n- [KMD REST API](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/kmd/)\n- [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/)\n- [How DApps work with MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/how-it-works#dapps)\n"}],["20240102-use-echo-web-framework",{"title":"Use Echo Web Framework","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWhich Go web framework should be used to create the local wallet connection server?

KMD's key management code should need very little modification, while the session management code is insufficient for a desktop wallet for end-users in a nondevelopment environment.\n\n**Confidence**: Medium.

It is a huge and flexible modeling language has been used frequently by a variety of projects over the years. However, the use of UML has declined in recent years in favor of more lightweight (and perhaps less organized) methods of diagraming systems which has resulted in newer developers not being familiar with UML.\n\n- Pro: Has many options and tools because of being well-established in software engineering\n- Con: UML diagrams can be clunky or contain too many details that make them difficult to read and understand\n\n### C4\n\nC4 is a lightweight modeling system for software architecture with 4 levels of abstraction: Context, Containers, Components, and Code. It was created in 2006, which makes it fairly new to the software engineering world.\n\n- Pro: C4 diagrams tend to be simpler to read and understand than UML\n- Pro: The diagrams can be specified in a text files and committed to a Git repository\n- Pro: Can be combined with UML for more detailed diagrams\n- Con: Not as many tools for it because it is not a very well-known modeling system\n\n## Links\n\n- [Unified Modeling Language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)\n- [C4 model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_model)\n- [The C4 model for visualising software architecture](https://c4model.com/)\n"}],["20240219-document-threat-model",{"title":"Document the Threat Model","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nA more formal process for addressing and mitigating security concerns is crucial for designing, building and maintaining a desktop wallet application.

Unfortunately, only one part-time developer is available to build this desktop wallet prototype. This is unlike most good wallets, which have so many features and components that they require a team of developers to build and manage them. The amount of developer time and effort available for building this project very limited. That precious developer time and effort needs to go to the features and components of the desktop wallet that will yield the most results in the shortest amount of time possible.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Developer time and effort**: The amount of time and effort available for development is very limited\n- **Only the basic features are necessary**: There are so many features commonly found in good wallet software. However, most of these features are not needed to build a prototype that yields insightful results.\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to make user interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) low priorities with the desktop wallet prototype. Getting the UI and UX right takes a lot of time and effort. This time and effort is better spent on building the basic features. Although the quality of the UI and UX will likely suffer significantly, it should not get in the way of assessing the security and technical feasibility of desktop wallet prototype.\n\n**Confidence:** High\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- More development time and effort can go to the experimentation of critical security and technical components\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- The UI would probably not look good\n- The UI may be difficult for many users\n- It is possible for the UI to be so terrible that it undermines security and usefulness of features\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to: <AdrLink slug=\"20250531-no-major-upgrades-for-frontend-dependencies\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"No Major Upgrades for Frontend Dependencies\" customLabel=\"No Major Upgrades for Frontend Dependencies\" />\n"}],["20240603-use-svelte-as-frontend-framework",{"title":"Use Svelte as Frontend Framework","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nA JavaScript/TypeScript framework is typically used to make building a user interface (UI) easier. As such, using the right framework should make development of the UI components as quick and easy as possible.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Compatibility with Wails 3.0**: The TypeScript framework to be used for the frontend should work well with Wails\n- **Amount of time needed to learn**: Prefer a framework that does not need a large amount of time (more than 1 week) to be proficient enough to build the frontend functionality\n- **Support for TypeScript**: The framework should be able to be used with TypeScript\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- ~~Next.js~~\n- Svelte\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose Svelte after trying Next.js and Svelte. Despite the developer's familiarity with Next.js, it did not work well with Wails and is simply not the right tool for the job when it comes to this project. Fortunately, Svelte is fairly easy to learn. It is one of the most recommended JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks in the Wails community.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. The developer for this project (No-Cash-7970) has never used Svelte for a sizable project before. However, there are many in the Wails community who have claimed to have used Svelte and have gotten desirable results.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Next.js\n\nThe developer initially attempted to build a basic UI for the desktop wallet app using Next.js because of her familiarity with it. Unfortunately, it did not function well with Wails. The compilation of the code broke most of the time because of Next.js build errors. In the instances where the build did not break, the UI broke from the awkward and inefficient handling of state and the \"hydration\" issues caused by the Wails JavaScript/TypeScript bindings. In short, **Next.js is no longer an option because of these issues.**\n\n### Svelte\n\nAfter the failed attempt with Next.js, the developer tried building a basic UI for the desktop wallet app using Svelte. This was the same UI that did not work when built with [Next.js](#nextjs). Fortunately, Svelte worked well with Wails without any problems.\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240101-use-wails-ui-framework\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Wails UI Framework\" customLabel=\"Use Wails UI Framework\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240101-build-using-go-and-typescript\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Build Using Go and TypeScript\" customLabel=\"Build Using Go and TypeScript\" />\n"}],["20240821-use-hawk-for-dapp-connection-authentication-and-authorization",{"title":"Use Hawk for DApp Connection Authentication and Authorization","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nFor the <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"dApp connection server\" />, which authentication or authorization scheme should be used?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security:** The authentication/authorization solution should mitigate security threats [THREAT-001](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-001-impersonation-of-a-trustworthy-dapp-or-platform) and [THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-wallet-connection-server).\n- **Ability to be used for localhost:** Localhost does not behave exactly like a normal web server connection. One of the most notable differences is the efficacy of using SSL/TLS. Using SSL/TLS on localhost is largely useless.\n- **DApp developer experience:** DApps come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and not all of them may be web-based in a web browser. The goal is to maintain a satisfying developer experience for dApps of all kinds when using this desktop wallet. This means making the integration of the desktop wallet as simple and easy as possible for as many platforms as possible.\n- **Flexibility:** Allow for software other than a browser to connect to and use the wallet. Also allow for the dApp connection server to separated from local user's computer and placed into a global web server.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Hawk\n- API key\n- OAuth 2.0\n- Cookie\n- Nothing\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose Hawk. Hawk is a solution that in somewhere between OAuth 2.0 and API key authentication. It has most of the powerful features that OAuth 2.0 has with the straightforwardness of API key authentication.\n\n**Confidence:** Very low. Using Hawk may be overkill and not very effective for an HTTP connection that is on localhost. It is also possible that Hawk is not a long-lasting solution and would not be able to adjust to the changing security landscape because of the lack of development.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Hawk\n\n[Hawk](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk) was designed to be an alternative to OAuth 2.0 that is easier for developers to use.\n\n- Pro: Provides straightforward and flexible schemes for authentication/authorization\n- Pro: Support using \"scopes\" that would restrict what a connected dApp is allowed to as for in the wallet\n- Con: Not very well known, so there are not that many up-to-date tools and libraries that support Hawk\n- Con: There will no further maintenance at this time because the protocol is considered \"complete\"\n- Con: Relies on the dApp being able to securely store the shared secret key that is needed to authenticate. Some dApps, especially web page dApps, may not be able to securely store a secret key.\n\n### API Key Authentication\n\nAPI key authentication is a simple method for authentication where the dApp is given a key that it must provide to make an authenticated request.\n\n- Pro: Method used by the original KMD code, so it would be easy to implement (copy & paste)\n- Pro: Simple to understand, which makes it fairly easy to maintain\n- Con: Requires user to enter the API key into dApp. This would greatly degrade user experience, possibly to the point where it compromises security.\n\n### OAuth 2.0\n\nOAuth 2.0 is one of the most common tools for authentication/authorization. It is the mechanism used to create the \"Log in with XXX\" methods that make it easier and safer for users to log in without entering a password.\n\n- Pro: A commonly used method for authentication and authorization, so there are plenty of tools and libraries that support OAuth 2.0\n- Pro: Provides dApps with more flexibility in storing wallet connection session data\n- Pro: Support using \"scopes\" that would restrict what a connected dApp is allowed to ask for in the wallet\n- Con: Heavily relies on SSL/TLS for security, which is not ideal for a localhost connection\n- Con: Does not provide a straightforward scheme for authentication/authorization, so using a third-party authentication/authorization service is typically encouraged\n\n### Cookie\n\nUsing a cookie to store wallet connection session data. The data is stored on the server by the wallet and within the browser (in the form of a cookie) by the dApp.\n\n- Pro: A tried-and-true method that is sometimes considered more secure than \"stateless\" methods like OAuth 2.0 and API key.\n- Con: Browser only\n\n### Nothing\n\nNo authentication or authorization scheme is used. The connection between the dApp and the dApp connection server is completely unsecured.\n\n- Pro: Extremely easy to implement and maintain\n- Con: Provides no reliable way of restricting dApps in any way (e.g. permissions, length of time allowed to connect to wallet)\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" />\n- Relates to [Use \\\"DApp\\\" in Prose and \\\"Dapp\\\" in Code](20250608-use-dapp-in-prose-and-dapp-in-code.md)\n- Relates to [Use \\\"DApp Connect\\\" Term for Wallet-DApp Connection](20250608-use-dapp-connect-term-for-wallet-dapp-connection.md)\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250609-terms-for-parts-of-dapp-connect\" status=\"draft\" title=\"Terms for Parts of DApp Connect\" customLabel=\"Terms for Parts of DApp Connect\" />\n- Refined by <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" />\n- [Hawk - GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk)\n"}],["20240927-use-memguard",{"title":"Use MemGuard","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nSome of the [go-algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand) maintainers have said multiple times that the Key Management Daemon (KMD) is not \"production-ready\" and is only meant to be used for developing with Algorand.

There is a security issue involving how the wallet password and the secret keys are temporarily stored in memory for convenience. The problem with storing secret data like keys in memory is that they can end up on disk unencrypted due to memory swapping/paging.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security:** The solution must reduce or eliminate possibility unencrypted wallet passwords or secret keys getting exposed to the disk while stored in memory\n- **Ease of use:** Prefer a solution that takes care of the minute details of securing data in memory\n- **Cross-platform:** The solution needs to be able to be compiled on Linux, Mac and Windows.

It should be cross-platform because it is written in pure Go. Using `mlockall` as an option is killed by the fact that it is a Linux-only command.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. This is a common problem with the kind of software that is often written Go. MemGuard is the best pure Go solution found so far.\n\nUPDATE (2024-10-17): No problems using Memguard so far with KMD.

Part of a key establishment protocol for the dApp connect shared secret key has been implemented using ECDH with no problems before this decision was formally made and documented.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- No secret data is sent over the network\n- Most dApps should be capable of using ECDH, especially if an SDK for dApp connect is available for a dApp to use\n- If the X25519 variation of ECDH (ECDH using [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519)) is used, it may be possible for an Algorand account key pair to be used for authenticating with the dApp connection server\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- More [threats](../threat-model/01-threats.md) due to the increase in complexity. Some of these new threats require deeper analysis of the dApp connect feature to be able to identify them.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman\n\nElliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is the elliptic-curve (EC) variant of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol. ECDH is what allows the [Buttercup Desktop](https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop) password manager to securely connect to its [browser extension](https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-browser-extension). Buttercup's mechanism for securely connecting its desktop app to its browser extension is similar to the <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"dApp connect mechanism\" /> needed for the desktop wallet.\n\n- Pro: A commonly used key exchange protocol, so there are a libraries for doing it properly in a large number of languages. Go has the native `crypto/ecdh` package for it.\n- Pro: No secret is transmitted in plaintext, so it works for localhost where SSL/TLS is likely to be ineffective\n- Con: The increased complexity can open the door to more [threats](../threat-model/01-threats.md)\n- Con: Vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack ([THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-wallet-connection-server)) where a malicious actor intercepts requests and generates their own key pairs to do DH key exchanges with the server and the client. This allows the actor to intercept messages without being detected by either the client or the server. [Other variants of DH](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/#recovery-from-compromise), not just ECDH, have this issue because this is [an issue with DH](https://asecuritysite.com/dh/diffie_crack) itself.\n\n### Transmit Shared Secret Key in Plaintext\n\nThe shared secret key would be generated by the server and sent to the dApp in plaintext as a normal HTTP response.\n\n- Pro: Very simple\n- Con: Requires ignoring [THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-wallet-connection-server), where a bad actor intercepts the transmission of the shared secret key and obtains the shared secret key that is unprotected by SSL/TLS on localhost\n\n## Links\n\n- Refines <AdrLink slug=\"20240821-use-hawk-for-dapp-connection-authentication-and-authorization\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Hawk for DApp Connection Authentication and Authorization\" customLabel=\"Use Hawk for DApp Connection Authentication and Authorization\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250609-terms-for-parts-of-dapp-connect\" status=\"draft\" title=\"Terms for Parts of DApp Connect\" customLabel=\"Terms for Parts of DApp Connect\" />\n- [ECDH Key Exchange - Practical Cryptography for Developers](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/ecdh-key-exchange)\n- [Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)\n- [Diffie–Hellman key exchange - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)\n"}]]}
