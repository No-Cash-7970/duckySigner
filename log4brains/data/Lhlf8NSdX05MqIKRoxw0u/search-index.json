Scratch","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nThere is no easy-to-use desktop wallet, that is not a website or a browser extension, for signing transactions from decentralized apps (DApps) in Algorand that fully support most of Algorand's features.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security:** Website wallets and browser extension wallets are not very secure for holding a user's private keys, but they are the only wallet options for desktop that can interact with DApps in Algorand. The MyAlgo data breach of user private keys proved how insecure website wallets can be and how devastating such a breach can be.\n- **Longevity:** A website wallet can be shut down and be inaccessible to the user. While browser extension wallets typically do not have this same problem, a user could lose the ability to download and and install the extension if the extension is closed source and removed from the marketplace (like the Chrome Store).\n- **Cross-Platform:** A wallet should be able to be used by most desktop users, most of whom are using either Linux, Mac or Windows operating systems.\n- **Developer Ambition:** The developer (No-Cash-7970) has been a full-stack web developer for years and wants to try building something that is not a website.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Build a desktop wallet that is not a website or browser extension from scratch\n2. Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for Algorand's Key Management Daemon (KMD)\n3. Do nothing\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to build a desktop wallet from scratch, because if built correctly, the desktop wallet from scratch would be the most secure and possibly longest-lasting solution while giving the developer a chance to build something that is not a website. However, some of KMD's designs can be used as a guide for building a desktop wallet from scratch.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. Building a desktop wallet should be feasible with a reasonable amount of time and effort. However, despite there being some architecture design ideas to achieve the goals for the desktop app, it is unclear if those design ideas will pan out.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Build Desktop Wallet from Scratch\n\nBuild a wallet for desktop that is not a website or a browser extension. The user would download and install the desktop wallet app. The user's keys would stored only on their computer.\n\n- Pro: If built correctly, a desktop wallet that does not depend on the user's browser would be the most secure wallet option for desktop.\n- Pro: Desktop wallet app that is downloaded and installed allows the user more control over the wallet app and more privacy.\n- Pro: This would be a challenge that provides the developer an opportunity to build something potentially useful that is not a website or trivial tutorial.\n- Con: Risky. If the wallet is built insecurely, there could be a massive mess like the MyAlgo breach.\n- Con: Among the options, this requires the most time, effort, and research to do well. The ways for users to utilize Algorand's more esoteric and advanced features would have to built from scratch using an Algorand SDK.\n\n### Create a GUI for KMD\n\nCreate a GUI that get input from the user and calls KMD using that input. The GUI would serve merely as a more friendly interface for KMD.\n\n- Pro: Would be able to take advantage of KMD's security that was developed by the Algorand team with less effort.\n- Pro: Utilizing KMD would make it easier to support almost all of Algorand's features.\n- Pro: It is a challenge that provides the developer an opportunity to build something potentially useful that is not a website or trivial tutorial.\n- Con: KMD does not work very well with Windows without using Docker and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) because the Algorand node software was built for and tested on *nix operating systems (Mac and Linux). It may not be possible to get a working solution for Windows that does not require the user to download and set up Docker and WSL using this option.\n- Con: It is difficult to separate the `kmd` daemon from the [go-algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand) code base into a standalone tool that does not include unnecessary components such as `algod` and `goal`.\n\n### Do Nothing\n\nDo nothing and let the problem remain as it is. Some might say this is the smartest option.\n\n- Pro: The safest, easiest and most comfortable option. Maybe someone else more capable would develop a solution (and a possibly a better one) to the problem.\n- Con: Does not solve the problem. For some reason, no one seems to have taken up solving the problem despite there being a demand for a solution. It is possible that no one will ever try to solve this problem because it is deemed too difficult, risky and unprofitable.\n- Con: No challenge for the developer to use as an opportunity.\n\n## Links\n\n- Superseded by <AdrLink slug=\"20240217-integrate-kmd-wallet-management-code\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Integrate KMD Wallet Management Code\" customLabel=\"Integrate KMD Wallet Management Code\" />\n- [List of Algorand Wallets](https://developer.algorand.org/ecosystem-projects/?tags=wallets)\n- [Incident Report about the 2023 MyAlgo data breach](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Incident%20Reports/RandLabs_MyAlgo_Wallet_Executive_Summary_Halborn%20.pdf)\n"}],["20240101-build-using-go-and-typescript",{"title":"Build Using Go and TypeScript","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWhich programming language(s) should be used to implement the Algorand wallet for desktop?

In addition to Wails, Next.js will be used as the TypeScript/JavaScript because the developer is familiar with the framework.\n\n**Confidence**: Medium. It is not clear if using Wails will help produce the desired results within a reasonable amount of time.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Wails\n\nWails is a desktop app framework for building with Go and web technologies (HTML, Javascript/TypeScript, CSS). According to its documentation it is a \"lightweight and fast Electron alternative for Go.\"\n\nWebsite: <https://wails.io/>\n\n- Pro: The developer can utilize her knowledge in frontend web development to build a good-looking modern UI\n- Pro: Utilizes Go, which a language with a lower learning curve that offers great cross-platform support\n- Pro: There is an active Discord server with helpful people who can answer questions\n- Pro: Free and open source under MIT license\n- Con: The documentation is messy and many things are not explained clearly.\n- Con: Many of the tutorials available are outdated and not very useful\n- Con: Some useful features, such as notifications, are not yet supported.\n\n### Gio UI\n\nGio is a cross-platform UI library for Go.

In Algorand, the one of the main reasons for using wallet software is to connect to DApps.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Protection of user keys:** Connected DApps must not be able to access the user's wallet keys. An unauthorized third-party must not be able to access the user's keys.\n- **Spoofing and fraud prevention:** An unauthorized third-party should not be able to intercept communications and present themselves as something or someone they are not\n- **Stability of connection between DApp and wallet app:** The connection should be reliable for the DApp and the wallet app to communicate\n- **Difficulty for DApps to integrate:** Prefer a method that makes it easy for DApps to connect to the wallet app\n- **User privacy:** User's information should not be sent to the DApp or some third-party. All communications should be contained within the user's machine.\n- **Reasonable usage of computer resources:** Must not consume an \"unreasonable\" amount of the user's computing resources (RAM, storage space, CPU, etc). The exact definition of \"unreasonable\" has yet to be determined.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Local server REST API\n- WalletConnect\n- A \"DApp store\"\n- Just don't\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to use a local server REST API because it should not consume much of the user's computing resources while providing a stable and private connection to DApps. Additional well-known protection and security measures, such as SSL/TLS, _may_ be used.\n\n**Confidence**: Low. A local server may not be able to be secure enough. May also be an issue for users with machines that have a strict firewall.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Local Server REST API\n\nAn HTTP(S) server integrated into the wallet app that serves only on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, which should not be exposed to anywhere outside the user's machine. DApps in the browser or installed on the user's machine can connect and interact with this local server through REST API requests. This is a method that Algorand's Key Management Daemon (KMD) uses to securely connect and interact with other services (which may be DApps).\n\n- Pro: Entirely on the user's machine\n- Pro: Almost every kind of software that can connect to the internet is capable of doing REST API calls\n- Pro: HTTP(S) server connections tend to be reliable and widely supported\n- Con: Firewall on user's machine may cause problems\n- Con: May not be secure enough, especially in the scenario where malicious software is installed on the user's machine\n- Con: Requires the development and maintenance of a library for DApps to easily connect and interact with the local server.\n\n### WalletConnect\n\nWalletConnect is the most widespread method for wallets to connect to DApps.\n\n- Pro: The most well-established method for connecting to wallets\n- Pro: If there is a way to integrate into a desktop app, it should require only a little time and effort to get working\n- Con: Seems to be no support for connecting to a wallet that is not a mobile wallet\n- Con: Connection is managed a third-party closed-source system\n- Con: There have been complaints about WalletConnect connections not being reliable\n\n### DApp store\n\nA type of \"app store\" for DApps, which would be integrated into the desktop wallet app. This would be like MyEtherWallet's \"DApps Center\" where MyEtherWallet only interacts with a list of registered DApps.\n\n- Pro: Could provide a nice experience for the user\n- Con: Would take a large amount of time and effort to build and maintain\n- Con: DApp developers would most likely be unwilling spend the time and effort to integrate their DApps into the desktop wallet app\n\n### Just Don't\n\nDo not bother trying to get the desktop wallet to interact with DApps. The desktop wallet would only be for storing keys and looking up the statuses of wallet accounts.

KMD's key management code should need very little modification, while the session management code is insufficient for a desktop wallet for end-users in a nondevelopment environment.\n\n**Confidence**: Medium.

Most good wallets have so many features and components that they require a team of developers to build and manage them. Unfortunately, only one part-time developer is available to build this desktop wallet prototype. This makes the amount of developer time and effort available for building this project very limited. That precious developer time and effort needs to go to the features and components of the desktop wallet that will yield the most results in the shortest amount of time possible.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Developer time and effort**: The amount of time and effort available for development is very limited\n- **Only the basic features are necessary**: There are many features that users in wallet software. However, most of these features are not needed to build a prototype that yields insightful results.\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to make user interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) low priorities. Getting the UI and UX right takes a lot of time and effort. This time and effort is better spent on building the basic features.

Despite the developer's familiarity with Next.js, it did not work well with Wails and is simply not the right tool for the job when it comes to this project. Fortunately, Svelte is fairly easy to learn. It is one of the most recommended JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks in the Wails community.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. The developer for this project (No-Cash-7970) has never used Svelte for a sizable project before. However, there are many in the Wails community who have claimed to have used Svelte and have gotten desirable results.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Next.js\n\nTried building a basic UI using Next.js with Wails because of the developer's familiarity with it. Next.js did not function well with Wails. The compilation of the code broke most of the time because of Next.js build errors. In the instances where the build does not break, the UI breaks from the awkward and inefficient handling of state and \"hydration\" issues caused by the Wails JavaScript/TypeScript bindings. **Next.js is no longer an option because of these issues.**\n\n### Svelte\n\nTried building a basic UI using Svelte. This is the same UI that did not work when built with [Next.js](#nextjs).

One of the most notable differences is the efficacy of using SSL/TLS.\n- **DApp developer experience:** DApps come in a variety of kinds, and not all of them may be web-based in a web browser. The goal is to maintain a satisfying developer experience for dApps of all kinds when using this desktop wallet. This means making the integration of the desktop wallet as simple and easy as possible for as many platforms as possible.\n- **Flexibility:** Allow for software other than a browser to use the wallet. Also allow for the dApp connection server to separated from local user's computer and placed into a global web server.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Hawk\n- API key\n- OAuth 2.0\n- Cookie\n- Nothing\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose Hawk. Hawk is a solution that in somewhere between OAuth 2.0 and API key. It has most of the powerful features that OAuth 2.0 has with the straightforwardness of API key.\n\n**Confidence:** Very low. Using Hawk may be overkill and not very effective for an HTTP connection that is on localhost. It is also possible that Hawk is not a long-lasting solution that would not be able to adjust to the changing security landscape because of the lack of development.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Hawk\n\nHawk was designed to be an alternative to OAuth 2.0 that is easier for developers to use.\n\n- Pro: Provides straightforward and flexible schemes for authentication/authorization\n- Pro: Support using \"scopes\" that would restrict what a connected dApp is allowed to as for in the wallet\n- Con: Not very well known, so there are not that many up-to-date tools and libraries that support Hawk\n- Con: The protocol is considered \"complete\" and there will no further maintenance at this time\n\n### API Key\n\nAPI key authentication is a simple method for authentication where the dApp is given a key that it must provide to make an authenticated request.\n\n- Pro: Method used by the original KMD code, so it would be easy to implement (copy & paste)\n- Pro: Easy to implement\n- Con: Requires user input API key into dApp, which would degrades user experience\n\n### OAuth 2.0\n\nOAuth 2.0 is one of the most common tools for authentication/authorization. It is behind the \"Log in with XXX\" methods that make it easier and safer for users to log in without entering a password.\n\n- Pro: Commonly used method for authentication and authorization, so there are plenty of tools and libraries that support OAuth 2.0\n- Pro: Provides dApps with more flexibility in storing wallet connection session data\n- Pro: Support using \"scopes\" that would restrict what a connected dApp is allowed to as for in the wallet\n- Con: Heavily relies on SSL/TLS for security\n- Con: Does not provide a straightforward scheme for authentication/authorization, so using a third-party authentication/authorization service is encouraged.\n\n### Cookie\n\nUsing a cookie to store wallet connection session data. The data is stored on the server by the wallet and within the browser (in the form of a cookie) by the dApp.\n\n- Pro: A tried-and-true method that is sometimes considered more secure than \"stateless\" methods like OAuth 2.0 and API key.\n- Con: Browser only\n\n### Nothing\n\nNo authentication or authorization scheme is used. The connection between the dApp and the dApp connection server is completely unsecured.\n\n- Pro: Extremely easy to implement and maintain\n- Con: Provides no reliable way of restricting dApps in any way (e.g. permissions, length of time allowed to connect to wallet)\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" />\n"}],["20240927-use-memguard-for-preventing-secret-data-in-memory-being-swapped-to-disk",{"title":"Use MemGuard to Prevent Secret Data in Memory Being Swapped to Disk Unencrypted","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nSome of the [go-algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand) maintainers have said multiple times that the Key Management Daemon (KMD) is not \"production-ready\" and is only meant to be used for developing with Algorand. Although the reason for why KMD is not production-ready has not been fully explained, the code comments and the documentation of KMD point to possible reasons why. One possible reason is mentioned in [KMD's documentation](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/tree/8b6c443d6884b4c0d3e3b3faf35b886fb81598a3/daemon/kmd#preventing-memory-from-swapping-to-disk). There is a security issue involving how the wallet password and the secret keys are temporarily stored in memory for convenience. The problem with storing secret data like keys in memory is that they can end up on disk unencrypted due to memory swapping/paging.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security:** The solution must reduce or eliminate possibility unencrypted wallet passwords or secret keys getting exposed to the disk while stored in memory.\n- **Ease of use:** Prefer a solution that takes care of the minute details of securing data in memory.\n- **Cross-platform:** The solution needs to be able to be compiled on Linux, Mac and Windows. Stay away from a solution that uses CGo because it requires GCC, which is difficult to install on Windows.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Using `mlockall` command\n- [MemGuard](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/awnumar/memguard) Go package\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose MemGuard. It should be cross-platform because it is written in pure Go. Using `mlockall` as an option is killed by the fact that it is a Linux-only command.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. This is a common problem with the kind of software that is often written Go. MemGuard is the best pure Go solution found so far.\n\nUPDATE (2024-10-17): No problems using Memguard so far with KMD. After looking into the code, it appears Memguard does what it says it does.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Using `mlockall` command\n\nA [Linux command](https://linux.die.net/man/2/mlockall) that locks the memory for a process from being put into the swap on disk. This is the solution recommended in the [KMD documentation](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/tree/8b6c443d6884b4c0d3e3b3faf35b886fb81598a3/daemon/kmd#preventing-memory-from-swapping-to-disk).\n\n- Con: Linux only\n- Pro: Common and well-tested solution for preventing memory swapping/paging\n- Pro: Good documentation\n\n### MemGuard\n\nA [Go package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/awnumar/memguard) for creating a \"software enclave.\" With a software enclave, memory swapping/paging would be less of an issue because the secret data in memory is encrypted. Therefore, the secret data is less likely to end up on disk unencrypted.\n\n- Pro: Pure Go, no CGo required\n- Pro: Good documentation\n- Con: Somewhat complex to use\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240217-integrate-kmd-wallet-management-code\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Integrate KMD Wallet Management Code\" customLabel=\"Integrate KMD Wallet Management Code\" />\n- [MemGuard on GitHub](https://github.com/awnumar/memguard)\n- [KMD Code (with documentation)](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/tree/8b6c443d6884b4c0d3e3b3faf35b886fb81598a3/daemon/kmd#preventing-memory-from-swapping-to-disk)\n"}]]}
