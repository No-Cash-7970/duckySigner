Scratch","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nThere is no easy-to-use desktop wallet, that is not a website or a browser extension, for signing transactions from decentralized apps (DApps) in Algorand that fully support most of Algorand's features.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security**: Website wallets and browser extension wallets are not the most secure for holding a user's private keys, but they are the only wallet options for desktop that can interact with DApps in Algorand. A browser extension wallet is typically more secure than a website wallet. The MyAlgo (a website wallet) data breach of user private keys proved how insecure website wallets can be and how devastating such a breach can be.\n- **Longevity:** A website wallet can be shut down and be inaccessible to the user. While browser extension wallets typically do not have this same problem, a user could lose the ability to download and and install the extension if the extension is closed source and removed from the marketplace (like the Chrome Store).\n- **Cross-Platform:** A wallet should be able to be used by most desktop users, most of whom are using either Linux, Mac or Windows operating systems.\n- **Developer Ambition:** The developer (No-Cash-7970) has been a full-stack web developer for years and wants to try building something that is not a website.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Build a desktop wallet that is not a website or browser extension from scratch\n2. Create a graphical user interface (GUI) wrapper for Algorand's Key Management Daemon (KMD)\n3. Do nothing\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to build a desktop wallet from scratch, because if built correctly, the desktop wallet from scratch would be the most secure and possibly longest-lasting solution while giving the developer a chance to build something that is not a website. However, some of KMD's designs can be used as a guide for building a desktop wallet from scratch.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. Building a desktop wallet should be feasible with a reasonable amount of time and effort. However, despite there being some architecture design ideas to achieve the goals for the desktop app, it is unclear if those design ideas will pan out.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Build Desktop Wallet from Scratch\n\nBuild a wallet for desktop that is not a website or a browser extension. The user would download and install the desktop wallet app. The user's keys would stored only on their computer.\n\n- Pro: If built correctly, a desktop wallet that does not depend on the user's browser would be the most secure wallet option for desktop.\n- Pro: Desktop wallet app that is downloaded and installed allows the user more control over the wallet app and more privacy.\n- Pro: This would be a challenge that provides the developer an opportunity to build something potentially useful that is not a website or trivial tutorial.\n- Con: Risky. If the wallet is built insecurely, there could be a massive mess like the MyAlgo breach.\n- Con: Among the options, this requires the most time, effort and research to do well. The ways for users to utilize Algorand's more esoteric and advanced features would have to built from scratch using an Algorand SDK.\n\n### Create a GUI wrapper for KMD\n\nCreate a GUI that gets input from the user and calls KMD using that input. The GUI would merely serve as a more friendly interface for KMD.\n\n- Pro: Would be able to take advantage of KMD's security that was developed by the Algorand team with less effort.\n- Pro: Utilizing KMD would make it easier to support almost all of Algorand's features.\n- Pro: It is a challenge that provides the developer an opportunity to build something potentially useful that is not a website or trivial tutorial.\n- Con: KMD does not work very well with Windows without using Docker and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) because the Algorand node software was built for and tested on \\*nix operating systems (Mac and Linux). It may not be possible to get a working solution for Windows that does not require the user to download and set up Docker and WSL using this option.\n- Con: It is difficult to separate the `kmd` daemon from the [go-algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand) code base into a standalone tool that does not include unnecessary components such as `algod` and `goal`.\n\n### Do Nothing\n\nDo nothing and let the problem remain as it is. Some might say this is the smartest option.\n\n- Pro: The safest, easiest and most comfortable option. Maybe someone else more capable would develop a solution (and a possibly a better one) to the problem.\n- Con: Does not solve the problem. For some reason, no one seems to have taken up solving the problem yet despite there being a demand for a solution. It is possible that no one will ever try to solve this problem because it is deemed too difficult, risky and unprofitable.\n- Con: No challenge for the developer to use as an opportunity.\n\n## Links\n\n- Superseded by <AdrLink slug=\"20240217-integrate-kmd-wallet-management-code\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Integrate KMD Wallet Management Code\" customLabel=\"Integrate KMD Wallet Management Code\" />\n- [List of Algorand tools and infrastructure, which includes wallets](https://algorand.co/ecosystem/infrastructure-tools)\n- [Incident Report about the 2023 MyAlgo data breach](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Incident%20Reports/RandLabs_MyAlgo_Wallet_Executive_Summary_Halborn%20.pdf)\n- [List of Algorand wallets (outdated)](https://developer.algorand.org/ecosystem-projects/?tags=wallets)\n"}],["20240101-build-using-go-and-typescript",{"title":"Build Using Go and TypeScript","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWhich programming language(s) should be used to implement the Algorand wallet for desktop? May need to use multiple languages.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Available help and documentation:** Prefer a language where there is plenty of documentation and a large community to go to for help\n- **Free and open source tools and libraries:** Prefer a language with libraries and tools for building a production-ready desktop graphical user interface (GUI) while providing as much flexibility as possible\n- **Easy to build for multiple platforms:** Prefer a language that can be used to build for as many computer platforms and operating systems as possible, especially Linux, Mac and Windows\n- **Amount of time needed to learn:** Prefer a language that does not need a large amount of time (2 weeks or more) to be proficient enough to build a functioning and modern-looking desktop app\n- **Developer's familiarity with other languages:** Prefer to use languages that the developer (No-Cash-7970) is familiar with (besides Go) like TypeScript, Python, and PHP\n- **Developer's interests:** The developer wants to learn Go and make something with it because Go is becoming one of the most popular languages\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Go\n- TypeScript/JavaScript\n- Rust\n- Python\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to use Go with TypeScript/JavaScript. Go is an easy-to-learn language that can be easily compiled for the multiple operating systems.

In Algorand, the one of the main reasons for using wallet software is to connect to DApps.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Protection of user keys:** Connected DApps must not be able to access the user's wallet keys. An unauthorized third-party must not be able to access the user's keys.\n- **Spoofing and fraud prevention:** An unauthorized third-party should not be able to intercept communications and present themselves as something or someone they are not\n- **Stability of connection between DApp and wallet app:** The connection should be reliable for the DApp and the wallet app to communicate\n- **Difficulty for DApps to integrate:** Prefer a method that makes it easy for DApps to connect to the wallet app\n- **User privacy:** User's information should not be sent to the DApp or some third-party. All communications should be contained within the user's machine.\n- **Reasonable usage of computer resources:** Must not consume an \"unreasonable\" amount of the user's computing resources (RAM, storage space, CPU, etc.). The exact definition of \"unreasonable\" has yet to be determined.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Local server REST API\n- WalletConnect\n- A \"DApp store\"\n- Just don't try\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to use a local server REST API because it should not consume much of the user's computing resources while providing a stable and private connection to DApps.

A local server may not be able to be secure enough. May also be an issue for users with machines that have a strict firewall.~~\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Local Server REST API\n\nAn HTTP(S) server integrated into the wallet app that serves only on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, which should not be exposed to anywhere outside the user's machine. DApps in the browser or installed on the user's machine can connect and interact with this local server through REST API requests. This is a method that Algorand's Key Management Daemon (KMD) uses to securely connect and interact with other services (which may be DApps).\n\n- Pro: Entirely on the user's machine\n- Pro: Almost every kind of software that can connect to the internet is capable of doing REST API calls\n- Pro: HTTP(S) server connections tend to be reliable and widely supported\n- Con: Firewall on user's machine may cause problems\n- Con: May not be secure enough, especially in the scenario where malicious software is installed on the user's machine\n- Con: Requires the development and maintenance of a library for DApps to easily connect and interact with the local server.\n\n### WalletConnect\n\nWalletConnect is the most widespread method for wallets to connect to DApps.\n\n- Pro: The most well-established method for connecting to wallets\n- Pro: If there is a way to integrate into a desktop app, it should require only a little time and effort to get working\n- Con: There seems to be no support for connecting to a wallet that is not a mobile wallet\n- Con: Connection is managed a third-party closed-source system\n- Con: There have been complaints about WalletConnect connections not being reliable\n\n### DApp store\n\nA type of \"app store\" for DApps, which would be integrated into the desktop wallet app. This would be like MyEtherWallet's \"DApps Center\" where MyEtherWallet only interacts with a list of registered DApps.\n\n- Pro: Could provide a nice experience for the user\n- Con: Would take a large amount of time and effort to build and maintain\n- Con: DApp developers would most likely be unwilling spend the time and effort to integrate their DApps into the desktop wallet app\n\n### Just don't try\n\nDo not bother trying to get the desktop wallet to interact with DApps. The desktop wallet would only be for storing keys and looking up the statuses of wallet accounts.

Although the quality of the UI and UX will likely suffer significantly, it should not get in the way of assessing the security and technical feasibility of desktop wallet prototype.\n\n**Confidence:** High\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- More development time and effort can go to the experimentation of critical security and technical components\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- The UI would probably not look good\n- The UI may be difficult for many users\n- It is possible for the UI to be so terrible that it undermines security and usefulness of features\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to: <AdrLink slug=\"20250531-no-major-upgrades-for-frontend-dependencies\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"No Major Upgrades for Frontend Dependencies\" customLabel=\"No Major Upgrades for Frontend Dependencies\" />\n"}],["20240603-use-svelte-as-frontend-framework",{"title":"Use Svelte as Frontend Framework","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nA JavaScript/TypeScript framework is typically used to make building a user interface (UI) easier. As such, using the right framework should make development of the UI components as quick and easy as possible.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Compatibility with Wails 3.0**: The TypeScript framework to be used for the frontend should work well with Wails\n- **Amount of time needed to learn**: Prefer a framework that does not need a large amount of time (more than 1 week) to be proficient enough to build the frontend functionality\n- **Support for TypeScript**: The framework should be able to be used with TypeScript\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- ~~Next.js~~\n- Svelte\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose Svelte after trying Next.js and Svelte. Despite the developer's familiarity with Next.js, it did not work well with Wails and is simply not the right tool for the job when it comes to this project. Fortunately, Svelte is fairly easy to learn. It is one of the most recommended JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks in the Wails community.\n\n**Confidence:** (2025-07-16) High. Using Svelte 4 has yielded desirable results. Unit testing the fronted with Svelte has also worked well. There are no plans to upgrade to Svelte 5, which is supposed to have a number of improvements over Svelte 4.\n\n~~**Confidence:** Medium. The developer for this project (No-Cash-7970) has never used Svelte for a sizable project before. However, there are many in the Wails community who have claimed to have used Svelte and have gotten desirable results.~~\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Next.js\n\nThe developer initially attempted to build a basic UI for the desktop wallet app using Next.js because of her familiarity with it. Unfortunately, it did not function well with Wails. The compilation of the code broke most of the time because of Next.js build errors. In the instances where the build did not break, the UI broke from the awkward and inefficient handling of state and the \"hydration\" issues caused by the Wails JavaScript/TypeScript bindings. In short, **Next.js is no longer an option because of these issues.**\n\n### Svelte\n\nAfter the failed attempt with Next.js, the developer tried building a basic UI for the desktop wallet app using Svelte. This was the same UI that did not work when built with [Next.js](#nextjs). Fortunately, Svelte worked well with Wails without any problems.\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240101-use-wails-ui-framework\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Wails UI Framework\" customLabel=\"Use Wails UI Framework\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240101-build-using-go-and-typescript\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Build Using Go and TypeScript\" customLabel=\"Build Using Go and TypeScript\" />\n"}],["20240821-use-hawk-for-dapp-connect-authentication-and-authorization",{"title":"Use Hawk for DApp Connect Authentication and Authorization","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nFor the <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"dApp connect server\" />, which authentication or authorization scheme should be used?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security:** The authentication/authorization solution should mitigate security threats [THREAT-001](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-001-impersonation-of-a-trustworthy-dapp-or-platform) and [THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-dapp-connect-server).\n- **Ability to be used for localhost:** Localhost does not behave exactly like a normal web server connection. One of the most notable differences is the efficacy of using SSL/TLS. Using SSL/TLS on localhost is largely useless.\n- **DApp developer experience:** DApps come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and not all of them may be web-based in a web browser. The goal is to maintain a satisfying developer experience for dApps of all kinds when using this desktop wallet. This means making the integration of the desktop wallet as simple and easy as possible for as many platforms as possible.\n- **Flexibility:** Allow for software other than a browser to connect to and use the wallet. Also allow for the dApp connect server to separated from local user's computer and placed into a global web server.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Hawk\n- API key\n- OAuth 2.0\n- Cookie\n- Nothing\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose Hawk. Hawk is a solution that in somewhere between OAuth 2.0 and API key authentication. It has most of the powerful features that OAuth 2.0 has with the straightforwardness of API key authentication.\n\n**Confidence:** Very low. Using Hawk may be overkill and not very effective for an HTTP connection that is on localhost. It is also possible that Hawk is not a long-lasting solution and would not be able to adjust to the changing security landscape because of the lack of development.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Hawk\n\n[Hawk](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk) was designed to be an alternative to OAuth 2.0 that is easier for developers to use.\n\n- Pro: Provides straightforward and flexible schemes for authentication/authorization\n- Pro: Support using \"scopes\" that would restrict what a connected dApp is allowed to as for in the wallet\n- Con: Not very well known, so there are not that many up-to-date tools and libraries that support Hawk\n- Con: There will no further maintenance at this time because the protocol is considered \"complete\"\n- Con: Relies on the dApp being able to securely store the shared secret key that is needed to authenticate. Some dApps, especially web page dApps, may not be able to securely store a secret key.\n\n### API Key Authentication\n\nAPI key authentication is a simple method for authentication where the dApp is given a key that it must provide to make an authenticated request.\n\n- Pro: Method used by the original KMD code, so it would be easy to implement (copy & paste)\n- Pro: Simple to understand, which makes it fairly easy to maintain\n- Con: Requires user to enter the API key into dApp. This would greatly degrade user experience, possibly to the point where it compromises security.\n\n### OAuth 2.0\n\nOAuth 2.0 is one of the most common tools for authentication/authorization. It is the mechanism used to create the \"Log in with XXX\" methods that make it easier and safer for users to log in without entering a password.\n\n- Pro: A commonly used method for authentication and authorization, so there are plenty of tools and libraries that support OAuth 2.0\n- Pro: Provides dApps with more flexibility in storing dApp connect session data\n- Pro: Support using \"scopes\" that would restrict what a connected dApp is allowed to ask for in the wallet\n- Con: Heavily relies on SSL/TLS for security, which is not ideal for a localhost connection\n- Con: Does not provide a straightforward scheme for authentication/authorization, so using a third-party authentication/authorization service is typically encouraged\n\n### Cookie\n\nUsing a cookie to store dApp connect session data. The data is stored on the server by the wallet and within the browser (in the form of a cookie) by the dApp.\n\n- Pro: A tried-and-true method that is sometimes considered more secure than \"stateless\" methods like OAuth 2.0 and API key.\n- Con: Browser only\n\n### Nothing\n\nNo authentication or authorization scheme is used. The connection between the dApp and the dApp connect server is completely unsecured.\n\n- Pro: Extremely easy to implement and maintain\n- Con: Provides no reliable way of restricting dApps in any way (e.g. permissions, length of time allowed to connect to wallet)\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" />\n- Relates to [Use \\\"DApp\\\" in Prose and \\\"Dapp\\\" in Code](20250608-use-dapp-in-prose-and-dapp-in-code.md)\n- Relates to [Use \\\"DApp Connect\\\" Term for Wallet-DApp Connection](20250608-use-dapp-connect-term-for-wallet-dapp-connection.md)\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250621-vocab-for-dapp-connect\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Vocabulary for DApp Connect\" customLabel=\"Vocabulary for DApp Connect\" />\n- Refined by <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250619-dapp-connect-protocol\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"DApp Connect Protocol\" customLabel=\"DApp Connect Protocol\" />\n- [Hawk - GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk)\n"}],["20240927-use-memguard",{"title":"Use MemGuard","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nSome of the [go-algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand) maintainers have said multiple times that the Key Management Daemon (KMD) is not \"production-ready\" and is only meant to be used for developing with Algorand. Although the reason for why KMD is not production-ready has not been fully explained, the code comments and the documentation of KMD point to possible reasons why.\n\nOne possible reason for why KMD is not \"production ready\" is mentioned in [KMD's documentation](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/tree/8b6c443d6884b4c0d3e3b3faf35b886fb81598a3/daemon/kmd#preventing-memory-from-swapping-to-disk). There is a security issue involving how the wallet password and the secret keys are temporarily stored in memory for convenience. The problem with storing secret data like keys in memory is that they can end up on disk unencrypted due to memory swapping/paging.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security:** The solution must reduce or eliminate possibility unencrypted wallet passwords or secret keys getting exposed to the disk while stored in memory\n- **Ease of use:** Prefer a solution that takes care of the minute details of securing data in memory\n- **Cross-platform:** The solution needs to be able to be compiled on Linux, Mac and Windows.

The inconsistency makes the documentation more confusing and the code harder to understand. A single term needs to be chosen and used consistently throughout the documentation and the code.\n\nA decision on this matter is important because the wallet-dApp connection mechanism is a key standout feature of the desktop wallet.

For this to happen, a protocol needs to be established between the dApp and the desktop wallet's <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"dApp connect server on localhost\" />. In this protocol, each dApp (or dApp instance) must be able to identify itself to the server and confirm its unique identity.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Includes the decision drivers for the <AdrLink slug=\"20240821-use-hawk-for-dapp-connect-authentication-and-authorization\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Hawk for DApp Connect Authentication and Authorization\" customLabel=\"decision to use Hawk\" />\n- **DApp connect session management:** The dApp connect protocol needs to be able to (1) establish a session between a dApp and the desktop wallet, (2) let dApps end their sessions, (3) let the server end any session, and (4) let the server receive and store information about connected dApps\n- **Known related threats:** [THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-dapp-connect-server), [THREAT-010](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-010-dapp-connect-server-overwhelmed-by-too-many-requests-or-requests-that-are-too-large), [THREAT-012](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-012-modifying-security-settings-in-configuration-files), [THREAT-013](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-013-wallet-password-is-written-down-and-stored-in-insecure-location), [THREAT-022](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-022-multiple-dapps-establishing-connect-sessions-with-the-same-dapp-id)\n- **User experience (UX):** Asking the user to enter their password too frequently degrades UX. Also, the user needs to be presented with relevant information for making an informed decision when approving a session and when ending a session.\n- **Session data stored in encrypted file(s):** DApp connect session data being stored in an encrypted file imposes some constraints that affect UX because the user's wallet password is needed to decrypt and access the session data. This problem is lessened by the fact that the wallet password is typically stored in memory while the wallet is unlocked and open.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Iteration 4: Mitigate [THREAT-009](./threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-dapp-connect-server) by requiring a \"confirmation code\", revert use of approvals and session tokens, remove session renewal\n- Iteration 3: Authentication using short sessions with long \"approval\"\n- Iteration 2: Mitigate [THREAT-022](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-022-multiple-dapps-establishing-connect-sessions-with-the-same-dapp-id), allow session to end if server is offline, add session \"ping\"\n- Iteration 1: Simplest iteration\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose Iteration 4. It strikes the right balance between security and UX.\n\n**Confidence**: Low. Despite this protocol being inspired by other protocols like OAuth, it is uncertain if this protocol is too complex for dApps. Because this is a new protocol, there may be some unknown security vulnerabilities lurking within this protocol.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- No secret data is transmitted unencrypted\n- A dApp that is not web-based can authenticate and interact with the desktop wallet\n- The user immediately knows when a dApp is trying to connect to the wallet\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- The dApp must be able to generate and store a secret key securely, which can be a problem for web dApps in a browser\n- This protocol adds more parts and moving pieces to the desktop wallet, which increases the attack surface of the wallet. There may be some unknown or unforeseen threats lurking in this protocol.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Iteration 4\n\nThis is the fourth attempt at designing the dApp connect protocol. In this iteration, session renewal and the use of session tokens were dropped. Instead of a session token, there is a single-use session *confirmation* token that a dApp gives to the server to check the \"confirmation code\" when confirming a session. Parts from the [first](#iteration-1) and [second](#iteration-2) iterations were combined to make a protocol that is simpler than the [third iteration](#iteration-3).\n\n#### Iteration 4 Session Establishment\n\nLike with the [second](#iteration-2-session-establishment) and [third](#iteration-3-session-establishment) iterations, establishing a session consists of initializing the session and then confirming it. However, confirming a session requires the dApp to display a \"confirmation code\" and the user to enter the code into the wallet's UI. This mitigates the threat of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack ([THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-dapp-connect-server)) that was not mitigated in the previous iterations.\n\nThere is no session token, unlike [Iteration 3](#iteration-3-session-establishment). Instead, there is a single-use \"confirmation token\". The confirmation token is used check the confirmation code entered by the user. This way, web tokens are [used in the way in which they are most suited](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/).\n\n1. **Initialize session**\n   1. DApp: Generate dApp key pair (dApp ID & dApp secret key)\n   2. DApp → Server: Send request to `/session/init`, providing dApp ID\n   3. Server: Validate received dApp ID\n   4. Server: Generate confirmation key pair (confirmation ID + confirmation secret key) and confirmation data (date created, expiration, etc.) and store it into an encrypted file protected by the user's wallet password\n   5. Server: Generate session key pair (session ID & session secret key).\n      - **Note:** Generating the session key pair and placing it into the confirmation token ensures that the confirmation token is only used once because the server cannot store multiple sessions same session ID when confirming the session. If there is an attempt to use an unexpired confirmation token after it has been used, the server will reject it because it already stores a session with the session ID within the confirmation token.\n   6. Server: Generate a confirmation code\n   7. Server: Use the confirmation key to create an encrypted \"confirmation token\" in [PASETO](https://paseto.io/) format that contains the dApp ID, session key pair, confirmation data and confirmation code\n   8. Server → DApp: Send authenticated response containing confirmation ID, data, code and token\n   9. DApp: Derive the \"confirmation shared secret key\" using dApp key and confirmation ID to verify authentication in the server's response\n2. **Confirm session**\n   1. DApp → User: Display confirmation code\n   2. DApp → Server: Send authenticated request to `/session/confirm`, providing dApp data (dApp name, icon, etc.), confirmation token and confirmation ID\n   3. Server: Retrieve confirmation key using given confirmation ID\n   4. Server: Derive confirmation shared key using the confirmation key and dApp ID\n   5. Server: Verify authentication and validate dApp data\n   6. Server: Extract data from confirmation token by decrypting it using confirmation key\n   7. Server → User: *(Through the UI)* Present dApp data and ask for approval of connection to dApp\n   8. User → Server: *(Through the UI)* Approve the connection to the dApp by entering password and confirmation code\n   9. Server: Generate session data (date created, expiration, etc.)\n   10. Server: Derive \"session shared secret key\" using dApp ID and session key for sending authenticated response\n   11. Server: Store session ID, session shared key, session data, dApp ID and dApp data into an encrypted file protected by the user's wallet password\n   12. Server → DApp: Send authenticated response containing session ID and session data\n   13. DApp: Derive the shared key using dApp key and session ID to verify authentication in the server's response\n   14. DApp: Store session ID and session data\n\nResult: The dApp can now use the session shared key to send authenticated requests to the server.\n\n#### Iteration 4 Authenticated Request\n\nSame as [Iteration 1](#iteration-1-authenticated-request).\n\n#### Iteration 4 Session Termination Through DApp\n\nA dApp can optionally end its session by contacting the server before deleting its stored session data, just like ending a session in [Iteration 1](#iteration-1-session-termination-through-dapp). This is the preferred method for a dApp to end its session. However, if the dApp cannot contact the server, the dApp simply deleting its stored session data, like with [Iteration 2](#iteration-2-session-termination-through-dapp), is acceptable.\n\nResult: The dApp cannot successfully send authenticated requests to the server without [establishing a new session](#iteration-4-session-establishment).\n\n#### Iteration 4 Session Termination Through Wallet\n\nSame as [Iteration 2](#iteration-2-session-termination-through-wallet).\n\nResult: The dApp cannot successfully send authenticated requests to the server without [establishing a new session](#iteration-4-session-establishment).\n\n#### Iteration 4 Session Renewal\n\nThere is no session renewal. It was removed because it is unnecessary. A session does not need to be short because no secret session data is transmitted unencrypted. A session should be able to safely last about 1-2 weeks, which should be long enough to not hurt UX too much.\n\nThis dApp connect protocol is supposed to replace the wallet session protocol used by <AdrLink slug=\"20240217-integrate-kmd-wallet-management-code\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Integrate KMD Wallet Management Code\" customLabel=\"Algorand's KMD wallet\" />. With KMD, renewing sessions was needed because the \"wallet handle\" a dApp (or client) needed to authenticate with the server was always sent in plain text. The ability to renew a wallet handle was a compromise to make it easier to use KMD. However, that renewal feature undermined the security of the KMD wallet session because a malicious actor could steal a wallet handle while it is still valid and renew it.\n\n#### Pros and Cons of Iteration 4\n\n- Pro: The requirement of a confirmation code when establishing a session mitigates threat of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack ([THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-dapp-connect-server))\n- Con: Like with [Iteration 2](#pros-and-cons-of-iteration-2), sessions cannot be very long and should not be very short. Finding the right session length will require some trial-and-error.\n- Con: Like with [Iteration 2](#pros-and-cons-of-iteration-2), the extra \"ping\" requests from dApps checking their session's validity can lead to a higher chance of the server being overwhelmed ([THREAT-010](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-010-dapp-connect-server-overwhelmed-by-too-many-requests-or-requests-that-are-too-large)).\n- Con: More work for a dApp because it needs to provide a way to display the confirmation code to the user\n\n### Iteration 3\n\nThis is the third attempt at designing the dApp connect protocol. It is supposed to improve upon the [second iteration](#iteration-2) by allowing for short sessions without the user needing to enter their password for a long period of time.\n\n#### Iteration 3 Session Establishment\n\nLike with the [second iteration](#iteration-2-session-establishment), establishing a session consists of initializing the session and then confirming it. Unlike the second iteration, this iteration includes the creation of an \"approval\" during session confirmation. An \"approval\" is data that represents the user's approval of the wallet's connection to a dApp. The server uses the \"approval secret key\" to create an encrypted \"session token\" and gives it to the dApp to use for authentication.\n\nAn approval can last for months while a session can last an hour. When the session expires, the dApp can renew the session and get a new token as long as the approval is valid. This mechanism is similar to [OAuth 2.0 grants](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/).\n\n1. **Initialize session** - Same as [Iteration 2](#iteration-2-session-establishment)\n2. **Confirm session**\n   1. DApp → Server: Send authenticated request to `/session/confirm`, providing dApp data (dApp name, icon, etc.)\n   2. Server: Verify authentication\n   3. Server → User: *(Through the UI)* Present dApp data and ask for approval of connection to dApp\n   4. User → Server: *(Through the UI)* Approve the connection to the dApp (by entering wallet password) and send the approval\n   5. Server: Generate approval secret key and approval data (approval index, expiration, etc.)\n   6. Server: Store approval key, approval data, dApp ID and dApp data into an encrypted file protected by the user's wallet password\n   7. Server: Generate session key pair (session ID & session secret key) and session data (date created, expiration, etc.)\n   8. Server: Use the approval key to create an encrypted \"session token\" in the [PASETO](https://paseto.io/) format that contains the dApp ID, session ID, session data and approval index\n   9. Server: Derive \"session shared secret key\" using dApp ID and session key or sending authenticated response\n   10. Server → DApp: Send authenticated response containing the token, session ID and session data\n   11. DApp: Derive the session shared key using dApp secret key and session ID to verify authentication in the server's response\n   12. DApp: Store token, session ID, session data and shared key\n\nResult: The dApp can now use the session shared key to send authenticated requests to the server.\n\n#### Iteration 3 Authenticated Request\n\nCertain requests require the dApp to be authenticated.\n\n1. DApp: Use the Hawk authentication scheme to create Hawk header data using session token and shared key\n2. DApp → Server: Place the Hawk header data into the request `Authorization` header and send request\n3. Server: Use the approval index (a part of the session token) to retrieve the approval key that will be used to decrypt the session token\n4. Server: Extract the shared session key from the decrypted token data\n5. Server: Verify the authentication of the dApp using the shared key according to the Hawk authentication scheme\n6. Server: Attempt to fulfill request\n7. Server → DApp: Send authenticated response\n\nResult: The dApp (maybe) gets what it needed from the server.\n\n#### Iteration 3 Session Termination Through DApp\n\nSame as [Iteration 2](#iteration-2-session-termination-through-dapp).\n\nResult: The dApp cannot successfully send authenticated requests to the server without [establishing a new session](#iteration-3-session-establishment).\n\n#### Iteration 3 Session Termination Through Wallet\n\nSame as [Iteration 1](#iteration-1-session-termination-through-wallet). Because sessions are short, the [\"ping\" requests for checking session validity in Iteration 2](#iteration-2-session-termination-through-wallet) are unnecessary.\n\nResult: The dApp cannot successfully send authenticated requests to the server without [establishing a new session](#iteration-3-session-establishment).\n\n#### Iteration 3 Session Renewal\n\nBefore a session is expired, a dApp can \"renew\" its session to continue being connected to the wallet as long as the session has not expired.\n\n1. DApp → Server: Send authenticated request to `/session/renew`\n2. Server: Decrypt session token and extract data\n3. Server: Verify authentication\n4. Server: Check approval is not expired\n5. Server: Create new session key pair and session data\n6. Server: Derive new session shared key using dApp ID and new session key\n7. Server: Create a new token containing the dApp ID, approval index, new session ID, new session data and new shared key\n8. Server → DApp: Send authenticated response containing the new token, session ID and session data\n9. DApp: Derive the new session shared key using dApp secret key and new session ID to verify authentication in the server's response\n10. DApp: Store new token, session ID, session data and shared key\n\nResult: The expiration of the session has been extended and the dApp can continue sending authenticated requests.\n\n#### Pros and Cons of Iteration 3\n\n- Pro: Allows for short sessions while not bothering the user asking them to approve a dApp connection frequently\n- Con: Shorter sessions can lead to a higher chance of the server being overwhelmed ([THREAT-010](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-010-dapp-connect-server-overwhelmed-by-too-many-requests-or-requests-that-are-too-large)) when too many dApps are renewing their sessions too frequently. Finding the right session length is crucial.\n- Con: When a session expires, the session cannot be renewed and the dApp must establish a new session, starting all over again. This makes the session renewal mechanism essentially useless and defeats the purpose of having this short-session/long-approval scheme. Attempting the [myriad of ways](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/19/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions-part-2-why-your-solution-doesnt-work/) of working around this issue leads to more issues or back to one of the same issues as before, which is why it is said that tokens are [not suited to be used for sessions](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/).\n- Con: Vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack ([THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-dapp-connect-server)) that is [common to Diffie-Hellman (DH) protocols](https://asecuritysite.com/dh/diffie_crack) where a malicious actor generates two key pairs to intercept dApp (client) requests and server responses by doing DH key exchanges with both of them.\n\n### Iteration 2\n\nThis is the second attempt at designing the dApp connect protocol. It is supposed to improve upon the [first iteration](#iteration-1) by addressing and fixing its core issues.\n\n#### Iteration 2 Session Establishment\n\nTo be able to authenticate itself to the server, a dApp must first obtain a \"session shared secret key\" by establishing a session with the server. To establish a session, the dApp must \"initialize\" the session to get a confirmation ID and then \"confirm\" the session by sending an authenticated request to the server. In confirming the session, the dApp proves it owns the dApp ID it initially provided to the server.\n\n1. **Initialize session**\n   1. DApp: Generate dApp key pair (dApp ID & dApp secret key)\n   2. DApp → Server: Send request to `/session/init`, providing dApp ID\n   3. Server: Validate received dApp ID\n   4. Server: Generate confirmation key pair (confirmation ID + confirmation secret key) and confirmation data (date created, expiration, etc.)\n   5. Server: Derive the \"confirmation shared secret key\" using dApp ID and confirmation key\n   6. Server: Store confirmation ID, confirmation shared key and confirmation data into an encrypted file protected by the user's wallet password\n   7. Server → DApp: Send authenticated response containing confirmation ID and confirmation data\n   8. DApp: Derive confirmation shared key using dApp key and confirmation ID to verify authentication in the server's response\n2. **Confirm session**\n   1. DApp → Server: Send authenticated request to `/session/confirm`, providing dApp data (dApp name, icon, etc.)\n   2. Server: Verify authentication and validate dApp data\n   3. Server → User: *(Through the UI)* Present dApp data and ask for approval of connection to dApp\n   4. User → Server: *(Through the UI)* Approve the connection to the dApp (by entering wallet password) and send the approval\n   5. Server: Generate session key pair (session ID & session secret key) and session data (date created, expiration, etc.)\n   6. Server: Derive the \"session shared secret key\" using dApp ID and session key\n   7. Server: Store session ID, shared key, session data (date created, expiration, etc.), dApp ID and dApp data into an encrypted file protected by the user's wallet password\n   8. Server → DApp: Send authenticated response containing session ID and session data\n   9. DApp: Derive the shared key using dApp key and session ID to verify authentication in the server's response\n   10. DApp: Store session ID and session data\n\nResult: The dApp can now use the session shared key to send authenticated requests to the server.\n\n#### Iteration 2 Authenticated Request\n\nSame as [Iteration 1](#iteration-1-authenticated-request).\n\n#### Iteration 2 Session Termination Through DApp\n\nThe dApp can end the session before the session expires. Unlike the [first iteration](#iteration-1-session-termination-through-dapp), the dApp does not contact the server.\n\n1. DApp: Delete its stored session data (session ID, shared key, etc.)\n2. DApp: *No contact with server*\n3. Server *(Some time later)*: Delete its stored session data because it expired or the session was manually ended from the wallet.\n\nResult: The dApp cannot successfully send authenticated requests to the server without [establishing a new session](#iteration-2-session-establishment).\n\n#### Iteration 2 Session Termination Through Wallet\n\nThe user, through the UI, can command the server to end the session before the session expires. However, the dApp does not immediately know that the session has ended. For the dApp to know when its session has as soon as possible, it should periodically \"ping\" the server to check if the session is still valid.\n\n1. \\[Optional\\] Session validity check (Valid session)\n   1. DApp → Server: Send authenticated request to `/session/:session_id`\n   2. Server: Verify authentication\n   3. Server: Check if session still exists\n   4. Server → DApp *(session exists)*: Send authenticated response with `200 OK` HTTP code\n   5. DApp: Use session shared key to verify authentication in the server's response\n2. End session\n   1. Wallet UI → Server: End session\n   2. Server: Delete session data (date created, expiration, etc.) from session database\n   3. Server → Wallet UI: Respond with success\n   4. Server: *No contact with DApp*\n3. \\[Optional\\] Session validity check (Invalid session)\n   1. DApp → Server: Send authenticated request to `/session/:session_id`\n   2. Server: Verify authentication\n   3. Server: Check if session still exists\n   4. Server → DApp *(session does not exist)*: Send authenticated response with `404 Not Found` HTTP code\n   5. DApp: Use session shared key to verify authentication in the server's response\n   6. DApp: Delete stored session data (session ID, shared key, etc.)\n\nResult: The dApp cannot successfully send authenticated requests to the server without [establishing a new session](#iteration-2-session-establishment).\n\n#### Iteration 2 Session Renewal\n\nSame as [Iteration 1](#iteration-1-session-renewal).\n\n#### Pros and Cons of Iteration 2\n\n- Pro: The server does not have to be online for a dApp to be able to end the session\n- Pro: Mitigates [THREAT-022](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-022-multiple-dapps-establishing-connect-sessions-with-the-same-dapp-id). A malicious actor cannot impersonate a dApp simply by using its dApp ID.\n- Con: Sessions cannot be very long (more than 2 weeks) because the shared key needs be changed frequently to reduce the damage in the case of the shared key being stolen. With short sessions, an attacker with a stolen key would be limited in how much damage they can cause. However, short sessions can ruin UX because the user has to enter their wallet password more frequently, which increases the likelihood of the user storing their password insecurely ([THREAT-013](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-013-wallet-password-is-written-down-and-stored-in-insecure-location)).\n- Con: The extra \"ping\" requests for a dApp to periodically check the session's validity are an extra burden on the server, which increases the chance of the server being overwhelmed ([THREAT-010](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-010-dapp-connect-server-overwhelmed-by-too-many-requests-or-requests-that-are-too-large)).\n- Con: Vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack ([THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-dapp-connect-server)) that is [common to Diffie-Hellman (DH) protocols](https://asecuritysite.com/dh/diffie_crack) where a malicious actor generates two key pairs to intercept dApp requests and server responses by doing DH key exchanges with both the dApp and the server.\n\n### Iteration 1\n\nThis is the first attempt at designing the dApp connect protocol, so it is the simplest one.\n\n#### Iteration 1 Session Establishment\n\nTo be able to authenticate itself to the server, the dApp must obtain a \"session shared secret key\" by establishing a session with the server.\n\n1. DApp: Generate dApp key pair (dApp ID & dApp secret key)\n2. DApp → Server: Send request to `/session/init`, providing dApp ID and dApp data (dApp name, icon, etc.)\n3. Server: Validate received dApp ID and information\n4. Server → User: *(Through the UI)* Present dApp data and ask for approval of connection to dApp\n5. User → Server: *(Through the UI)* Approve the connection to the dApp (by entering wallet password) and send the approval\n6. Server: Generate session key pair (session ID & session secret key) and session data (date created, expiration, etc.)\n7. Server: Derive the shared key using dApp ID and session key using <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" />\n8. Server: Store session ID, shared key, session data, dApp ID and dApp data into an encrypted file protected by the user's wallet password\n9. Server → DApp: Respond with session ID and session data\n10. DApp: Derive the shared key using dApp key and session ID using ECDH\n11. DApp: Store session ID, session data and shared key\n\nResult: The dApp can now use the session shared key to send authenticated requests to the server.\n\n#### Iteration 1 Authenticated Request\n\nCertain requests require the dApp to be authenticated.\n\n1. DApp: Use the Hawk authentication scheme to create Hawk header data using session ID and shared key\n2. DApp → Server: Place the Hawk header data into the request `Authorization` header and send request\n3. Server: Verify the authentication of the dApp using the shared key according to the Hawk authentication scheme\n4. Server: Attempt to fulfill request\n5. Server → DApp: Send response\n\nResult: The dApp (maybe) gets what it needed from the server.\n\n#### Iteration 1 Session Termination Through DApp\n\nThe dApp can end the session before the session expires.\n\n1. DApp → Server: Send authenticated request to `/session/end`\n2. Server: Verify authentication\n3. Server: Delete session data from session database\n4. Server → DApp: Respond with HTTP success code (maybe `200 OK` or `204 No Content`)\n5. DApp: Delete stored session data (session ID, shared key, etc.)\n\nResult: The dApp cannot successfully send authenticated requests to the server without [establishing a new session](#iteration-1-session-establishment).\n\n#### Iteration 1 Session Termination Through Wallet\n\nThe user, through the wallet UI, can command the server to end the session before it expires.\n\n1. Wallet UI → Server: Command to end session\n2. Server: Delete session data from session database\n3. Server → Wallet UI: Respond with success\n\nResult: The dApp cannot successfully send authenticated requests to the server without [establishing a new session](#iteration-1-session-establishment).\n\n#### Iteration 1 Session Renewal\n\nBefore the session is expired, a dApp can \"renew\" its session to continue being connected to the wallet as long as the session has not expired.\n\n1. DApp → Server: Send authenticated request to `/session/renew`\n2. Server: Verify authentication\n3. Server: Check session is not expired\n4. Server: Discard old session data, and create new session key pair and session data\n5. Server: Derive the new shared key using the dApp ID and the new session key using <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"ECDH\" />\n6. Server: Store new session ID, shared key and session data\n7. Server → DApp: Respond with new session ID and session data\n8. DApp: Derive the new shared key using dApp key (unchanged) and new session ID using ECDH\n9. DApp: Store session ID, session data and shared key\n\nResult: The expiration of the session has been extended and the dApp can continue sending authenticated requests.\n\n#### Pros and Cons of Iteration 1\n\n- Pro: Less complex, which makes it easier to understand\n- Con: Vulnerable to [THREAT-022](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-022-multiple-dapps-establishing-connect-sessions-with-the-same-dapp-id), where two or more dApps using the same dApp ID breaks the security of the protocol\n- Con: DApp cannot properly end session if server is offline\n- Con: DApp would still show user as connected to wallet (until session expiration passes) if session was terminated from wallet\n- Con: Vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack ([THREAT-009](../threat-model/01-threats.md#threat-009-interception-of-http-communication-between-dapp-and-dapp-connect-server)) that is [common to Diffie-Hellman (DH) protocols](https://asecuritysite.com/dh/diffie_crack) where a malicious actor generates two key pairs to intercept dApp requests and server responses by doing DH key exchanges with both of them.\n\n## Links\n\n- Refined by <AdrLink slug=\"20250621-use-paseto-for-security-tokens\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use PASETO for Security Tokens\" customLabel=\"Use PASETO for Security Tokens\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250621-vocab-for-dapp-connect\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Vocabulary for DApp Connect\" customLabel=\"Vocabulary for DApp Connect\" />\n- Relates to [Use \\\"DApp Connect\\\" Term for Wallet-DApp Connection](20250608-use-dapp-connect-term-for-wallet-dapp-connection.md)\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use ECDH for Establishing DApp Connect Shared Secret Key\" customLabel=\"Use ECDH for Establishing session shared Secret Key\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240821-use-hawk-for-dapp-connect-authentication-and-authorization\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Hawk for DApp Connect Authentication and Authorization\" customLabel=\"Use Hawk for DApp Connect Authentication and Authorization\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" />\n- [List of threats for this project](../threat-model/01-threats.md)\n- [Hawk API](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/blob/main/API.md)\n- [Diffie-Hellman (Man-in-the-middle) - Asecuritysite.com](https://asecuritysite.com/dh/diffie_crack)\n- [Platform-Agnostic SEcurity TOkens (PASETO)](https://paseto.io/)\n- [Stop using JWT for sessions - joepie91's Ramblings](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/)\n- [Stop using JWT for sessions, part 2: Why your solution doesn't work - joepie91's Ramblings](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/19/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions-part-2-why-your-solution-doesnt-work/)\n"}],["20250621-use-paseto-for-security-tokens",{"title":"Use PASETO for Security Tokens","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nThe <AdrLink slug=\"20250619-dapp-connect-protocol\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"DApp Connect Protocol\" customLabel=\"DApp connect protocol\" /> requires the server to issue security tokens to dApps. Each dApp eventually presents their token to the server. The tokens need to be in a format that enables the dApp connect protocol to be secure when the token is transferred over an insecure localhost connection.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security:** The token format should not be able to be cracked by any entity besides the issuer of the token (usually the server), thus making it safe to use on <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"localhost, where there is no SSL/TLS\" />\n- **Library in Go:** The security token must be able to be easily created in Go, the language used for the server. The library for the security token format must be maintained and up-to-date.\n- **Library in JavaScript/TypeScript and other languages:** Although it is unlikely that dApps will need to create their own security tokens, allow for it to be a possibility. DApps could be built in a variety of languages.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- PASETO\n- JWT\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose PASETO. It is easier to use because it requires less effort to use it securely and transmit it safely through localhost without SSL/TLS.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. Both the server and dApps should be able to handle PASETOs. However, PASETO is relatively unknown in the web development world.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### PASETO\n\n[PASETO (Platform-Agnostic SEcurity TOkens)](https://paseto.io/) (pronunciation: pah-SEH-toh) is a newer security token format that was created in 2018 as a [more secure replacement for JWT](https://paragonie.com/blog/2018/03/paseto-platform-agnostic-security-tokens-is-secure-alternative-jose-standards-jwt-etc).\n\n- Pro: Less error-prone, which makes it easier to use securely\n- Pro: Most of the libraries implement PASETO consistently because of how strict it is\n- Con: Tooling and literature for PASETO is limited because it is newer and less common\n\n### JWT\n\n[JWT (JSON Web Token)](https://jwt.io/introduction) (pronounced like \"jot\") has been around since 2010 and is often used for [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/).\n\n- Pro: The popularity of JWT means that there are plenty of tools and literature for JWT, which makes it easier to find help regarding JWT\n- Con: Transmitting JWT without SSL/TLS is [not recommended](https://snyk.io/blog/top-3-security-best-practices-for-handling-jwts/), which makes it difficult to use securely on localhost\n- Con: The overwhelming number of options for JWT make it difficult to use. JWT's level of security can vary greatly depending on the library that is used to create a token.\n\n## Links\n\n- Refines <AdrLink slug=\"20250619-dapp-connect-protocol\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"DApp Connect Protocol\" customLabel=\"DApp Connect Protocol\" />\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20250621-vocab-for-dapp-connect\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Vocabulary for DApp Connect\" customLabel=\"Vocabulary for DApp Connect\" />\n- [Platform-Agnostic SEcurity TOkens (PASETO)](https://paseto.io/)\n- [A Thorough Introduction to PASETO - Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/17/a-thorough-introduction-to-paseto)\n- [Paseto is a Secure Alternative to the JOSE Standards (JWT, etc.) - Paragon Initiative](https://paragonie.com/blog/2018/03/paseto-platform-agnostic-security-tokens-is-secure-alternative-jose-standards-jwt-etc)\n- [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction)\n- [No Way, JOSE!

DuckDB is a lightweight database that can easily be embedded using Go. Using DuckDB with Parquet files should provide easy support for encrypting whole data files. The robust support for encrypting a whole Parquet file is the primary reason for using DuckDB with Parquet files instead of the other options.\n\n**Confidence**: Low. DuckDB is not designed for use cases similar to this project's use case. If using DuckDB fails, then SQLite will have to be used.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- More privacy through the encryption of the entire data files\n- Data files will be tamper resistant because they are encrypted\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- A \"driver\" for KMD must be created for it to use DuckDB with Parquet files instead of SQLite\n- Accessing the data within the files may be significantly slower because they are encrypted\n- Must enable CGo. Fortunately, the [Go SQL Driver For DuckDB](https://github.com/marcboeker/go-duckdb) provides instructions on how to install GCC in Windows.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### DuckDB with Parquet Files\n\n[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an small in-process database designed for analytics. It can read and write [Parquet](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/data/parquet/overview) files directly.\n\n- Pro: The name is duck themed 🦆\n- Pro: Small and in-process like SQLite, making it very portable\n- Pro: An entire Parquet file does not need to be loaded into memory to read it, even when the file is encrypted\n- Pro: The Parquet file format is independent from DuckDB, so any Parquet file reader that supports encryption can read the files. The Parquet file encryption mechanism is part of the [specification](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/Encryption.md) and is [supported by DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/data/parquet/encryption) out of the box.\n- Pro: [Client in Go (Go SQL Driver For DuckDB)](https://github.com/marcboeker/go-duckdb) is officially supported. Unfortunately, it requires CGo.\n- Con: Not as common, so there is less support and documentation available. However, the documentation on the [official website](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/) is good.\n- Con: DuckDB is a columnar OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing) database that is designed for analytics, not for simple storing and retrieval of single rows in a table. However, its capability to handle data analysis may come in handy for certain features in the future.\n- Con: Cannot easily add to, delete from or update an item within a Parquet file. Entire file needs to be read and then written to a new file. This is fine as long as the data files remain small, but it will become a performance bottleneck if one or more data files becomes large.\n- Con: A new KMD \"driver\" needs to be created for KMD to use DuckDB instead of SQLite\n- Con: More files to manage. Unlike SQLite where all the wallet data is stored one database file, using the Parquet file format would require more files for the same data. This is because a Parquet file can store only one table.\n\n### DuckDB with DuckDB Database Files\n\n[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an small in-process database designed for analytics. It has its own native database format.\n\n- Pro: The name is duck themed 🦆\n- Pro: Fast for analytics, but analytics is not this project's use case\n- Con: DuckDB database files do not support encryption\n- Con: Offers no significant advantage over SQLite for this project's use case\n\n### SQLite\n\n[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) is an in-process database. It is the most popular database and is embedded in a variety of devices and environments.\n\n- Pro: Widely supported with plenty of documentation and tutorials\n- Pro: Small and in-process, which makes it very portable\n- Pro: Already used in KMD, which makes it easier to expand for other uses (e.g. storing dApp connect session data)\n- Pro: More efficient at adding, deleting and updating data\n- Pro: Multiple tables can be placed into one `.db` file, which is more convenient for moving or backing up data\n- Pro: There is a [Go SQLite Driver](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite) that does not require CGo\n- Con: Encrypting whole file is not easily supported. It requires installing an [extension](https://github.com/utelle/SQLite3MultipleCiphers) that would have to be managed separately.\n- Con: Data compression is not easily supported, which can become a problem as more data is stored\n\n### DuckLake\n\n[DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/) is an integrated data lake and catalog format, where a database is used to catalog and track the Parquet files within a data lake (a bunch of data files stored together somewhere).\n\n- Pro: The name is duck themed 🦆\n- Pro: Deletes, inserts and updates within Parquet files are handled by DuckLake, unlike with plain DuckDB with Parquet files where changes to a Parquet file require the whole file to be replaced\n- Pro: Utilizes DuckDB and Parquet files\n- Pro: Supports encryption\n- Con: Cannot set key used for encryption (a random key is generated for each Parquet file)\n- Con: Requires using \"snapshots\", which would create more bloat for this project's use case\n- Con: Designed to be used for massive amounts of data, which does not fit this project's use case\n\n## Links\n\n- Supersedes <AdrLink slug=\"20240103-use-sqlite-database-to-store-keys\" status=\"superseded\" title=\"Use SQLite Database to Store Keys\" customLabel=\"Use SQLite Database to Store Keys\" />\n- Related to <AdrLink slug=\"20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" customLabel=\"Use Local Server to Connect to DApps\" />\n- [Types of DBMS and Databases: Advantages, Limitations, and Best Applications - altexsoft](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/databases-database-management-systems/)\n- [Deep Dive into DuckDB with CTO Mark Raasveldt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9QlkXW4H9A)\n"}]]}
