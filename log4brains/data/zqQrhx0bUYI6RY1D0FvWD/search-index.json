How and why to fake it](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940).\n- The MADR format is lean and fits our development style.\n- The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance.\n- The MADR project is vivid.\n- Version 2.1.2 is the latest one available when starting to document ADRs.\n- The Log4brains patch adds more features, like tags.\n\nThe \"Log4brains patch\" performs the following modifications to the original template:\n\n- Change the ADR filenames format (`NNN-adr-name` becomes `YYYYMMDD-adr-name`), to avoid conflicts during Git merges.\n- Add a

and Problem Statement\n\nThere is no easy-to-use desktop wallet, that is not a website or a browser extension, for signing transactions from decentralized apps (DApps) in Algorand that fully support most of Algorand's features.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Security:** Website wallets and browser extension wallets are not very secure for holding a user's private keys, but they are the only wallet options for desktop that can interact with DApps in Algorand. The MyAlgo data breach of user private keys proved how insecure website wallets can be and how devastating such a breach can be.\n- **Longevity:** A website wallet can be shut down and be inaccessible to the user. While browser extension wallets typically do not have this same problem, a user could lose the ability to download and and install the extension if the extension is closed source and removed from the marketplace (like the Chrome Store).\n- **Cross-Platform:** A wallet should be able to be used by most desktop users, most of whom are using either Linux, Mac or Windows operating systems.\n- **Developer Ambition:** The developer (No-Cash-7970) has been a full-stack web developer for years and wants to try building something that is not a website.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Build a desktop wallet that is not a website or browser extension from scratch\n2. Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for Algorand's Key Management Daemon (KMD)\n3. Do nothing\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to build a desktop wallet from scratch, because if built correctly, the desktop wallet from scratch would be the most secure and possibly longest-lasting solution while giving the developer a chance to build something that is not a website. However, some of KMD's designs can be used as a guide for building a desktop wallet from scratch.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. Building a desktop wallet should be feasible with a reasonable amount of time and effort. However, despite there being some architecture design ideas to achieve the goals for the desktop app, it is unclear if those design ideas will pan out.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Build Desktop Wallet from Scratch\n\nBuild a wallet for desktop that is not a website or a browser extension. The user would download and install the desktop wallet app. The user's keys would stored only on their computer.\n\n- Pro: If built correctly, a desktop wallet that does not depend on the user's browser would be the most secure wallet option for desktop.\n- Pro: Desktop wallet app that is downloaded and installed allows the user more control over the wallet app and more privacy.\n- Pro: This would be a challenge that provides the developer an opportunity to build something potentially useful that is not a website or trivial tutorial.\n- Con: Risky. If the wallet is built insecurely, there could be a massive mess like the MyAlgo breach.\n- Con: Among the options, this requires the most time, effort, and research to do well. The ways for users to utilize Algorand's more esoteric and advanced features would have to built from scratch using an Algorand SDK.\n\n### Create a GUI for KMD\n\nCreate a GUI that get input from the user and calls KMD using that input. The GUI would serve merely as a more friendly interface for KMD.\n\n- Pro: Would be able to take advantage of KMD's security that was developed by the Algorand team with less effort.\n- Pro: Utilizing KMD would make it easier to support almost all of Algorand's features.\n- Pro: It is a challenge that provides the developer an opportunity to build something potentially useful that is not a website or trivial tutorial.\n- Con: KMD does not work very well with Windows without using Docker and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) because the Algorand node software was built for and tested on *nix operating systems (Mac and Linux). It may not be possible to get a working solution for Windows that does not require the user to download and set up Docker and WSL using this option.\n- Con: It is difficult to separate the `kmd` daemon from the [go-algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand) code base into a standalone tool that does not include unnecessary components such as `algod` and `goal`.\n\n### Do Nothing\n\nDo nothing and let the problem remain as it is. Some might say this is the smartest option.\n\n- Pro: The safest, easiest and most comfortable option. Maybe someone else more capable would develop a solution (and a possibly a better one) to the problem.\n- Con: Does not solve the problem. For some reason, no one seems to have taken up solving the problem despite there being a demand for a solution. It is possible that no one will ever try to solve this problem because it is deemed too difficult, risky and unprofitable.\n- Con: No challenge for the developer to use as an opportunity.\n\n## Links\n\n- [List of Algorand Wallets](https://developer.algorand.org/ecosystem-projects/?tags=wallets)\n- [Incident Report about the 2023 MyAlgo data breach](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Incident%20Reports/RandLabs_MyAlgo_Wallet_Executive_Summary_Halborn%20.pdf)\n"}],["20240101-build-using-go-and-typescript",{"title":"Build Using Go and TypeScript","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWhich programming language(s) should be used to implement the Algorand wallet for desktop?

Despite the less-than-stellar documentation, the community in the Wails Discord server should be able to assist with issues that may arise. In addition to Wails, Next.js will be used as the TypeScript/JavaScript because the developer is familiar with the framework.\n\n**Confidence**: Medium. It is not clear if using Wails will help produce the desired results within a reasonable amount of time.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Wails\n\nWails is a desktop app framework for building with Go and web technologies (HTML, Javascript/TypeScript, CSS). According to its documentation it is a \"lightweight and fast Electron alternative for Go.\"\n\nWebsite: <https://wails.io/>\n\n- Pro: The developer can utilize her knowledge in frontend web development to build a good-looking modern UI\n- Pro: Utilizes Go, which a language with a lower learning curve that offers great cross-platform support\n- Pro: There is an active Discord server with helpful people who can answer questions\n- Pro: Free and open source under MIT license\n- Con: The documentation is messy and many things are not explained clearly.\n- Con: Many of the tutorials available are outdated and not very useful\n- Con: Some useful features, such as notifications, are not yet supported.\n\n### Gio UI\n\nGio is a cross-platform UI library for Go. It is the most popular option for desktop apps written in Go.\n\nWebsite: <https://gioui.org/>\n\n- Pro: Supports a large number of platforms, including WebAssembly\n- Pro: Free and open source under MIT and Unlicense licenses\n- Pro: Well documented with plenty of tutorials\n- Pro: UI elements are good-looking and modern\n- Con: Has a larger learning curve because of its architecture (e.g. \"immediate mode\", “retained mode”)\n- Con: Seems somewhat inflexible\n\n### Fyne\n\nFyne is a toolkit for developing native desktop apps in Go. It is one of the more popular options for developing desktop apps in Go.\n\nWebsite: <https://fyne.io/>\n\n- Pro: The learning curve is moderate\n- Pro: UI elements are good-looking and modern\n- Pro: Well documented\n- Pro: Free and open source under BSD 3-Clause License\n- Pro: Cross-platform, including support for mobile\n- Con: The appearance of the UI elements seems to be inflexible, which results in most of the apps using Fyne looking similar\n\n### Electron\n\nElectron is a massively popular framework for building desktop apps using web technologies.\n\nWebsite: <https://www.electronjs.org/>\n\n- Pro: The developer can utilize her knowledge in frontend web development to build a good-looking modern UI\n- Pro: Plenty of documentation that is clear and well-organized, as well as plenty of tutorials\n- Pro: Designed to be cross-platform\n- Pro: Free and open source under MIT license\n- Con: Many complaints about apps built with Electron consuming a lot of computing resources.\n\n### Tauri\n\nTauri is a framework for building performant and secure desktop apps with Rust and web technologies\n\nWebsite: <https://tauri.app/>\n\n- Pro: The developer can utilize her knowledge in frontend web development to build a good-looking modern UI\n- Pro: Has great cross-platform support\n- Pro: Many features and UI elements\n- Pro: Free and open source under MIT license\n- Pro: Emphasis on security, which is important for a desktop wallet\n- Pro: Plenty of documentation that is clear and well-organized\n- Con: Uses Rust as the backend.

In Algorand, the one of the main reasons for using wallet software is to connect to DApps.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Protection of user keys:** Connected DApps must not be able to access the user's wallet keys. An unauthorized third-party must not be able to access the user's keys.\n- **Spoofing and fraud prevention:** An unauthorized third-party should not be able to intercept communications and present themselves as something or someone they are not\n- **Stability of connection between DApp and wallet app:** The connection should be reliable for the DApp and the wallet app to communicate\n- **Difficulty for DApps to integrate:** Prefer a method that makes it easy for DApps to connect to the wallet app\n- **User privacy:** User's information should not be sent to the DApp or some third-party. All communications should be contained within the user's machine.\n- **Reasonable usage of computer resources:** Must not consume an \"unreasonable\" amount of the user's computing resources (RAM, storage space, CPU, etc). The exact definition of \"unreasonable\" has yet to be determined.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Local server REST API\n- WalletConnect\n- A \"DApp store\"\n- Just don't\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to use a local server REST API because it should not consume much of the user's computing resources while providing a stable and private connection to DApps. Additional well-known protection and security measures, such as SSL/TLS, _may_ be used.\n\n**Confidence**: Low. A local server may not be able to be secure enough. May also be an issue for users with machines that have a strict firewall.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Local Server REST API\n\nAn HTTP(S) server integrated into the wallet app that serves only on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, which should not be exposed to anywhere outside the user's machine. DApps in the browser or installed on the user's machine can connect and interact with this local server through REST API requests. This is a method that Algorand's Key Management Daemon (KMD) uses to securely connect and interact with other services (which may be DApps).\n\n- Pro: Entirely on the user's machine\n- Pro: Almost every kind of software that can connect to the internet is capable of doing REST API calls\n- Pro: HTTP(S) server connections tend to be reliable and widely supported\n- Con: Firewall on user's machine may cause problems\n- Con: May not be secure enough, especially in the scenario where malicious software is installed on the user's machine\n- Con: Requires the development and maintenance of a library for DApps to easily connect and interact with the local server.\n\n### WalletConnect\n\nWalletConnect is the most widespread method for wallets to connect to DApps.\n\n- Pro: The most well-established method for connecting to wallets\n- Pro: If there is a way to integrate into a desktop app, it should require only a little time and effort to get working\n- Con: Seems to be no support for connecting to a wallet that is not a mobile wallet\n- Con: Connection is managed a third-party closed-source system\n- Con: There have been complaints about WalletConnect connections not being reliable\n\n### DApp store\n\nA type of \"app store\" for DApps, which would be integrated into the desktop wallet app. This would be like MyEtherWallet's \"DApps Center\" where MyEtherWallet only interacts with a list of registered DApps.\n\n- Pro: Could provide a nice experience for the user\n- Con: Would take a large amount of time and effort to build and maintain\n- Con: DApp developers would most likely be unwilling spend the time and effort to integrate their DApps into the desktop wallet app\n\n### Just Don't\n\nDo not bother trying to get the desktop wallet to interact with DApps. The desktop wallet would only be for storing keys and looking up the statuses of wallet accounts.

The lower-level diagrams showing more details about the software system should be descriptive enough to communicate what is happening while being able to be understood by those with software engineering knowledge but little or no knowledge about this project specifically.\n- **Ease of modifying and updating diagrams:** The diagrams should be able to be easily updated as the system changes\n- **Ability to sufficiently represent the system at multiple levels:** The diagrams should be able to represent multiple parts of the system at varying levels of abstraction (from system level to class component level)\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- UML (Unified Modeling Language)\n- C4 (Context, Containers, Components, Code)\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChose to use C4 diagrams to represent the software architecture. This decision comes after trying C4 diagrams out using [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/dsl). The diagrams should be updated as the system changes. Their visual graphic form should be accessible to the public.\n\n**Confidence**: Medium. Creating and maintaining the diagrams should be useful, but it is not clear if the extra time and effort required is worth it.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- More transparency through better communication of how the desktop wallet works\n- Can be a great help when designing the software architecture\n- Can help with threat modeling\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- More stuff to create and maintain, which takes away time and effort that can go to building and maintaining the software\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### UML\n\nThe Unified Modeling Language (UML) has been around for decades. It is a huge and flexible modeling language has been used frequently by a variety of projects over the years. However, the use of UML has declined in recent years in favor of more lightweight (and perhaps less organized) methods of diagraming systems which has resulted in newer developers not being familiar with UML.\n\n- Pro: Has many options and tools because of being well-established in software engineering\n- Con: UML diagrams can be clunky or contain too many details that make them difficult to read and understand\n\n### C4\n\nC4 is a lightweight modeling system for software architecture with 4 levels of abstraction: Context, Containers, Components, and Code. It was created in 2006, which makes it fairly new to the software engineering world.\n\n- Pro: C4 diagrams tend to be simpler to read and understand than UML\n- Pro: The diagrams can be specified in a text files and committed to a Git repository\n- Pro: Can be combined with UML for more detailed diagrams\n- Con: Not as many tools for it because it is not a very well-known modeling system\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20231231-build-algorand-desktop-wallet\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet\" customLabel=\"Build Algorand Desktop Wallet\" />\n- [Unified Modeling Language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)\n- [C4 model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_model)\n- [The C4 model for visualising software architecture](https://c4model.com/)\n"}]]}
