Please use this link to browse them.

## Development

The C4 diagrams are specified using [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) DSL (domain specific language) in the [`workspace.dsl` file](workspace.dsl).

To edit the diagrams, edit the `workspace.dsl` file. Although the `workspace.dsl` file can be edited with any text editor, it is recommended that you use one of the variations of Structurizr, such as the [Structurizr DSL web editor](https://structurizr.com/dsl) or [Structurizr Lite](https://github.com/structurizr/lite), which allow you to preview the diagrams while editing.

### Publishing diagrams

Changes to the diagrams through the `workspace.dsl` file are automatically published. [Structurizr Mini](https://github.com/bensmithett/structurizr-mini) is used to create a website for browsing the latest version of the diagrams.
