## Context and Problem Statement

Need to choose a license to permit the copying, distribution and modification of the code.

## Decision Drivers

- The license needs to permit copying, distributing and modifying the code
- [Integrating KMD code](20240217-integrate-kmd-wallet-management-code.md) requires the project code to be licensed under AGPL v3.0 without a commercial license from Algorand Technologies

## Considered Options

- MIT
- GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL v3.0)

## Decision Outcome

Chose to use GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL v3.0) license because [integrating KMD code](20240217-integrate-kmd-wallet-management-code.md) requires the project code to also be licensed under AGPL v3.0 without a commercial license from Algorand Technologies.

**Confidence**: High. AGPL v3.0 is a well-known license that is recognized as an [open source license](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3/) by the Open Source Initiative.
