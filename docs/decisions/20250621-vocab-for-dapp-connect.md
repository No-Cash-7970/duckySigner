## Context and Problem Statement

The desktop wallet's [DApp Connect](20250608-use-dapp-connect-term-for-wallet-dapp-connection.md) feature consists of several important parts that will need to be mentioned frequently. It helps if vocabulary terms are established for these important parts and then used consistently throughout the codebase and documentation.

## Decision Drivers

- **Descriptiveness:** Each term needs to be sufficiently descriptive and succinct
- **Prior use in project:** It is easier to use the terms that has been used frequently in this project's documentation and code

## Decision Outcome

Chose to establish the following terms for the parts of DApp Connect:

- **confirmation code** - A string of letters and/or numbers displayed to the user by the dApp to be entered into the wallet during session confirmation
- **confirmation ID** - An [ECDH](20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key.md) public key used to uniquely identify a session confirmation to the server
- **confirmation key pair** - A pair consisting of a confirmation key and its corresponding confirmation ID
- **confirmation secret key** - An [ECDH](20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key.md) private key generated by the server for session confirmation
- **confirmation shared secret key** - An [ECDH](20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key.md) shared secret key that only the server and a single dApp should have when establishing a session. It is used to confirm an initialized session.
  - *Aliases: "confirmation shared key", "confirmation shared secret", "shared secret key", "shared secret", "shared key"*
- **confirmation token** - A small collection of data that is encrypted by the server and given to the dApp for it to be able to confirm its session
- **dApp ID** - An [ECDH](20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key.md) public key that usually (but not necessarily) uniquely identifies a dApp to the server
- **dApp key pair** - A pair consisting of a dApp key and its corresponding dApp ID
- **dApp secret key** - An [ECDH](20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key.md) private key generated by a dApp
  - *Aliases: "dApp key", "secret key"*
- **server** - The [local server](20240102-use-local-server-to-connect-to-dapps.md) embedded within the desktop wallet for connecting to dApps
- **session** - A secure connection established between a dApp and the server
- **session confirmation** - The process for a dApp to confirm its identity by proving to the server its possession of its dApp key. Confirmation also includes the user confirming their desire to connect a dApp to the wallet by entering a confirmation code into the wallet.
- **session establishment** - The whole process of creating a new session, which consists of initializing the session and then confirming it
- **session ID** - An [ECDH](20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key.md) public key used to uniquely identify a session to the server
- **session initialization** - The process of starting a new session, which consists of a dApp presenting its dApp ID to the server
- **session key pair** - A pair consisting of a session key and its corresponding session ID
- **session secret key** - An [ECDH](20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key.md) private key generated by the server for a session
  - *Aliases: "session key", "secret key"
- **session shared secret key** - An [ECDH](20250611-use-ecdh-for-establishing-dapp-connect-shared-key.md) shared secret key that only the server and a single dApp should have during a session
  - *Aliases: "session shared key", "session shared secret", "shared secret key", "shared secret", "shared key"*

### Positive Consequences

- Consistent use of a clear terms improves documentation and code
- Less work in the long run

### Negative Consequences

- Older documentation and code that used other vocabulary terms need to be revisited and edited to use the newly decided terms
- More work is necessary in the more immediate term
